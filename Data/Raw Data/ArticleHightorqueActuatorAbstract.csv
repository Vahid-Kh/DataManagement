000-093-610-327-285,Climbing with Parallel Robots,2007-09-01,2007,book chapter,Bioinspiration and Robotics Walking and Climbing Robots,,I-Tech Education and Publishing,,Roque Saltaren; Rafael Aracil; Oscar Reinoso; Eugenio Yime,"Inherently, parallel robots present many advantages to climb in comparison with robots that use serial legs. The availability of a great number of redundant degrees of freedom on the climbing robots with legs does not necessarily increase the ability of those types of machine to progress in a complex workspace. The serial legs mechanisms have a sequential configuration that imposes high torques on the actuators placed on the base. Therefore, the architecture of serial legs of some climbing robots implies a limit on load capability. In contrast with the limitations of the climbing robots with legs, the use of a Gough–Stewart platform as a climbing robot (Stewart, 1965), solves many of these limitations and opens a new field of applications for this type of mechanism. In order to emphasize the great performance of the G–S parallel robot as a climbing robot, it is pertinent to remember that this type of parallel robot is based on a simple mechanical concept that consists of two rings (platforms) linked with six linear actuators joined through universal and spherical joints (this type of structure is also referenced as a 6-UPS parallel robot). These characteristics allow obtaining a mechanical structure of light weight and with high stiffness, which is able to reach high velocities and develop big forces with a very important advantage: the low cost of manufacturing (Lazard, 1992)). The forward kinematic of the G–S platform has been previously analyzed for many authors (Husty, 1994) (Dasgupta, 1994). This paper has been developed in based to references (Almonacid, 2003) (Aracil, 2003) (Aracil, 2006) and (Saltaren 2005) and reflects the state of the art of the researchers made by the authors during the last years. The morphology proposed for the parallel G–S platform as climbing robot is shown in Fig. 1(a). The G–S platform is formed by two rings joined with 6 linear actuators as UPS kinematics chains (where the U degrees of freedom belong to a universal joint, P is a prismatic degree of freedom that belongs to the linear actuator and S is the spherical joint) (Saltaren, 2000). The robot assembly around the tubular structure is carried out through a system of hinges. The holding systems are based on a series of grip devices built in each ring. Those grip devices hold the reference ring firmly attached to the tubular structure while the free ring is displaced by the control system. In Fig. 1(b), we show the climbing robot to work on the outside wall of pipes. In this case the platform of Fig. 1(a) is modified by adding two legs on each one of the external rings of the robot. These legs allow fastening one ring to the pipe while the other ring moves along the structure. The external rings can rotate increasing the working space of the robot.

Hamel; T.C. Widner,"This paper explores a new approach for extending the operating range of electrical servoactuators in applications such as high payload robotics and remote handling systems where, at present, only hydraulic systems are used. The fundamental idea is to incorporate a multi-speed transmission to ""spread"" a servomotor's torque-speed characteristics across a wider output speed range. This has the effect of allowing smaller high power motors to also deliver high torque at low speeds. Incorporating a multi-speed transmission allows motor size to be reduced while increasing the overall actuator power density in the process. The hypothesis of this research was that this power density increase would be sufficient to allow a greater range of electrically-actuated robot manipulators to be designed with distributed actuators such that the cost and complexity of centralized actuators with power transmissions could be avoided. An existing articulated manipulator design is used as a baseline to evaluate potential benefits of this concept for robotics. Among these are increased performance, dramatic reductions in manipulator complexity and reduced manufacturing and implementation costs.",2,,1208,1215,Servomotor; Hydraulic machinery; Engineering; Control engineering; Parallel manipulator; Payload; Artificial intelligence; Actuator; Telerobotics; Power density; Robotics,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=614302 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icra/icra1997.html#HamelW97 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=614302,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/robot.1997.614302,,10.1109/robot.1997.614302,2106945011,,0,003-682-282-925-773; 005-881-510-020-621; 015-359-740-583-252; 110-228-370-619-783; 124-591-656-263-836,5

Classical oil-powered onboard actuators used for steering gears (rudders, roll-stabilizing fins) are usually cumbersome, weighty, low-efficiency and costly plants, also requiring an heavy maintenance burden. The Italian Navy recently committed a research project to the University of Rome-Sapienza, aimed to define innovative inverter-fed full-electric actuation systems in alternative to the hydraulics. The new actuators had to guarantee the required dynamic performances, i.e. very high torques/forces at very low speeds, besides high affordability, redundancy, and, mostly, high efficiency. This paper proposes a new high-thrust permanentmagnet linear actuator for direct-drive of steering gears, through an appositely designed rotary-prismatic coupling. Mechanical and electrical drive sizing are shown, and force, speed, and efficiency performances are analyzed and compared with those of the original hydraulic plant.

The modular actuator of the orthosis is designed with a torque dense motor and a custom low-ratio transmission (24:1) to provide mechanical transparency to the user, allowing them to actively contribute to their joint kinematics during gait training. The 4.88 kg orthosis utilizes frameless components and light materials, such as aluminum alloy and carbon fiber, to reduce its mass. A human subject experiment demonstrates accurate torque control with high output torque during stance and low backdrive torque during swing at fast walking speeds.

Rogers; Tim C. Green; Richard W. Silversides,"This paper presents a fast mechanical diverter switch design suitable for new “arcless” hybrid onload tap-changing systems. In such systems, arcing at contact separation and contact closure is almost completely eliminated by the inclusion of alternate current paths incorporating semiconductor devices. This allows the use of compact, air-insulated mechanical contacts that do not need to withstand significant arc erosion or provide arc quenching. As a result, the moving mass and the drive system for the switch may be dramatically reduced in size, leading to low inertia of the moving parts and resulting in very rapid operation times. An integrated, high-torque, low-mass permanent-magnet actuator is presented that provides detent (unpowered) contact force coupled with a cantilever spring contact system sized for an 11-kV 2-MVA onload tap changer. The design delivers operation times of under 20 ms and is capable of sustaining more than 106 operations. The complete design is experimentally verified under representative electrical conditions, and contact wear levels comparable to pure mechanical (zero current) operation are demonstrated.",29,2,860,869,Detent; Electric arc; Electrical engineering; Tap changer; Engineering; Electrical contacts; Cantilever; Magnet; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Contact force,,,,UK EPSRC Doctoral Training Award,http://orca.cf.ac.uk/50459/ http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/17953/5/Low%20Wear%20Tap-Changer%20-%20June%202013.pdf https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6573413/ http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/17953 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76992461.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tpwrd.2013.2272335,,10.1109/tpwrd.2013.2272335,2034627150,,0,003-479-848-248-617; 013-546-449-256-820; 048-947-770-285-027; 057-096-821-712-708; 066-893-685-128-520; 071-651-180-089-158; 080-438-498-742-931; 082-387-798-201-69X; 139-197-806-147-742; 157-141-901-789-436; 166-816-531-710-67X; 187-346-735-716-211; 197-537-624-894-706,9

Carpenter,"Control-moment gyroscopes (CMGs) are power-e‐cient attitude-control actuators that produce high torques on spacecraft. In this study, a method is investigated for maneuvering robotic arm segments in a spacecraft-mounted, CMG-actuated agile imaging payload with minimal power usage. A real-time optimization method is presented that includes null motion in a closed-loop end-efiector tracking problem. The proposed approach involves flrst establishing kinematic relationships between the end-efiector attitude coordinates and joint coordinates. These transformations are used to track a two-coordinate end-efiector attitude command by simultaneously controlling three joint degrees of freedom. With the redundant degree of freedom, there are multiple joint-angle solutions corresponding to a given boresight attitude command. While tracking this command, null motion is added to the commanded joint angles. The augmented joint-angle command causes a change in the body and gimbal motion that ultimately reduces power consumption. The null-angle component is determined by computing the null projection of the cost gradient with respect to the joint angles. A quadratic cost function is deflned, which is the sum of the squares of power for each CMG gimbal. Simulation results demonstrate that the power consumption of the system, when measured by the integral of non-recoverable power, is reduced by up to 42% when a certain amount of null motion is included in the feedback loop.",,,,,Gimbal; Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Robotic arm; Gyroscope; Actuator; Spacecraft; Kinematics; Control theory; Degrees of freedom (statistics),,,,,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2008-7270 http://spacecraftresearch.com/files/CarpenterPeck_GNC2008.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2008-7270,,10.2514/6.2008-7270,2323192693,,0,022-367-574-721-165; 045-986-138-265-068; 053-235-348-397-731; 053-878-954-863-113; 060-628-246-722-864; 064-947-252-001-127; 084-232-385-780-650; 085-631-565-887-724; 113-260-008-307-495; 118-123-790-969-245; 123-998-241-901-072; 138-099-666-136-447; 180-836-225-200-888; 185-950-112-232-155,12

The realization of hybrid MPC depends on using Data Card and Matlab/ Simulink as the core of the control system. In addition, this paper discusses the using of Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) for optimal tuning of the traditional controller parameters as a part of hybrid MPC controller. The experimental implementation of the studied system has been investigated using REXROTH components. The Electro Hydraulic Servo System mechanism (EHSS) plays an important role in industrial applications, especially in flight simulators, aircraft landing gear system, material testing machine and hydraulic press machines. The key reason of applying hydraulic systems on these applications is that it can give a high torque and high force. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the values of performance criteria (settling, rise times and system overshoots) are the minimum in case of realization hybrid MPC position control over using traditional and MPC controllers. It also introduced that the integral time absolute error for various types of test signals (Multistep, sinusoidal and square signals) are a minimum values in case of using the proposed strategy in compared with the traditional and MPC controllers.

This statically-balanced direct drive robot has been constructed for stability analysis of the robot in constrained maneuvers.2-6 As a result of the elimination of the gravity forces (without any counter weights), smaller actuators and consequently smaller amplifiers were chosen. The motors yield acceleration of 5 g at the robot end point without overheating. High torque, low speed, brush-less AC synchronous motors are used to power the robot. Graphite-epoxy composite material is used for the construction of the robot links. A 4-node parallel processor has been used to control the robot. The dynamic tracking accuracy-with the feedforward torque method as a control law- has been derived experimentally. KEYWORDS: Direct drive; Robot; Statically balanced; Tracking accuracy; Linkage. the arm is only under its static load. 4. Structural Stiffness. The structural stiffness of the direct drive arms is greater than the non-direct drive systems. About 80% of the total mechanical compliance in most non-direct drive industrial robots is caused by transmission systems9.IO. The high structural stiffness allows for wide bandwidth control. The low structural stiffness of non-direct drive arm$, due to the existence of IIlany mechanical elements in the transmission system, is a limiting factor on achievement of a relatively wide bandwidth control system. 5. Backlash and Friction. The direct drive arms are free from mechanical backlash and friction due to elimination of transmission systems. A small mechanical backlash in the transmission system would cause the gear teeth to wear faster. The high rate of wear in the gear would develop an even larger backlash. About 25% of the torque in non direct drive arms is used to overcome the friction. II 6. Performance and Control. Because of elimination of the transmission systems, and consequently backlash, the control and performance analysis of direct drive arms is more straightforward than the non-direct drive arms (not necessarily ""easier""). 7. Accuracy. The accuracy of direct drive arms is questionable.

Biro; Felicia Surdu,"The present paper approaches a three-phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) analytical design, modeling and simulation for an electromechanical brake system in automotive applications. Analytical design of the electrical machine is validated by static simulation using JMAG-Studio, (a Finite element method based software). The Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC) method is an accurate yet simple method for predicting the flux density distribution for iterative design procedures. The MEC technique gives fast (minutes) and acceptably accurate results. It provides a trade off between conventional, empirical methods, having fast simulation times, limited accuracy and flexibility, and the Finite Element Method (FEM), which requires long simulation times (hours), but offers high accuracy and flexibility. INTRODUCTION Electromechanical Brake (EMB) Electric actuation is one of the actual trends in the automotive industry, due to its high reliability, energy efficiency and controllability. The need for faster brake responding, better fuel economy, simplified system assembly, easy maintenance, more environmentally friendly and improved safety design has resulted in new Electro-Mechanical Braking System (EMB). EMB system has already begun replacing the hydraulic one. This not only reduces the weight of vehicles, but also has the potential for a large number of new features. In the EMB case (Fig.1), the idea presented is to replace completely the hydraulic system in order to transmit the commands through the wire. For that, the braking force is generated directly at each wheel by high-performance electric motors controlled by an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), and executed by signals from an electronic pedal module, which includes 4 intelligent braking actuators [10]. Electrical motor proposed for EMB actuation As a major issue in automotives is represented by the need for improved fuel efficiency and much more flexibility concerning latest technologies used in X-ByWire’s, the current 14 V bus has become insufficient. Therefore, car manufactures has come to the conclusion that the solution is to increase the voltage and implement a new 42 V bus in the system. Some aspects have to be considered during the design of the brake by wire drive systems: reliability, performance, thermal and acoustic behavior, energy efficiency and cost. Figure 1: System layout of an electromechanical brake These applications require high performance motors with high torque/volume ratio, low inertia, high dynamic, low torque pulsations and low radial forces. In this paper a surface-mounted PMSM has been considered as a driving motor for brake-by-wire application because it offers the advantage of low rotor inertia (provide high torque at lower rotational speed), high efficiency, convenient heat dissipation structure and reduction of the motor size [2], [4], [9]. DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED PMSM Analytical Design The analytical design of a PMSM is a complex process, which includes literature studying for adopting optimal design methods for different targets as obtaining a lighter prototype, a minimum cogging torque variation, a higher torque and low losses.

These requirements are given in Table 1 and Fig.2 presents the torque-speed characteristic of an electrical motor for EMB [6].

These constraints address limited size, lower weight, low torque ripple content, fault tolerance. A three-phase, four-pole surface mounted PMSM was chosen with the topology presented in Figure 3. The design starts with the set of initial data that includes the input parameters presented in Table 2, the material data of the magnet, iron and conductors. The main dimensions of the stator lamination and rotor core were computed via an analytical design procedure, following the input data [1], [5], [8].

The variable blade index angle control can automatically change servo flap control position in flight. There is approximately 9% hover performance improvement achieved when the blade index angle is changed 30°. This system can also increase blade stall margin with a trade-off by slightly increasing the blade acceptable vibration level. Aircraft airspeed, vibration level, and pilot control positions are used in the design to feedback the index angle change requirement needed to achieve the design goal. High torque, low speed and high precision motion control actuators are used to move the blade when the aircraft has a vibration level higher than desired. The variable blade index angle control is designed in parallel with the main rotor flight control system.

Harry Asada; Takeo Kanade,"Abstract : This paper describes the design concept of a new robot based on the direct-drive method using rare-earth DC torque motors. Because these motors have high torque, light weight and compact size, we can construct robots with far better performance than those presently available. For example, we can eliminate all the transmission mechanism between the motors and their loads, such as reducers and chain belts, and construct a simple mechanism (direct-drive) where the arm links are directly coupled to the motor rotors. This elimination can lead to excellent performance: no backlash, low friction, low inertia, low compliance and high reliability, all of which are suited for high-speed high-precision robots. First we propose a basic configuration of direct-drive robots. Second a general procedure for designing direct-drive robots is shown, and the feasibility of direct drive for robot actuation is discussed in terms of weights and torques of joints. One of the difficulties in designing direct-drive robots is that motors to drive wrist joints are loads for motors to drive elbow joints and they are loads for motors at shoulders. To reduce this increasing series of loads is an essential issue for designing practical robots. We analyze the series of joint mass for a simplified kinematic model of the direct-drive robots, and show how the loads are reduced significantly by using rare-earth motors with light weight and high torque. We also discuss optimum kinematic structures with minimum arm weight. Finally, we describe the direct-drive robotic manipulator (CMU arm) developed at Carnegie-Mellon University, and verify the design theory.

Moreover the spread of drives for motor control and static converters with structures ever more complex, places the electrical engineer to face new challenges whose solution has as critical elements in the implementation of digital control techniques with the requirements of inexpensiveness and efficiency of the final product.; The successfully application of solutions using non-conventional static converters awake an increasing interest in science and industry due to the promising opportunities. However, in the same time, new problems emerge whose solution is still under study and debate in the scientific community ; During the Ph.D. course several themes have been developed that, while obtaining the recent and growing interest of scientific community, have much space for the development of research activity and for industrial applications.; The first area of research is related to the control of three phase induction motors with high dynamic performance and the sensorless control in the high speed range. The management of the operation of induction machine without position or speed sensors awakes interest in the industrial world due to the increased reliability and robustness of this solution combined with a lower cost of production and purchase of this technology compared to the others available in the market.; During this dissertation control techniques will be proposed which are able to exploit the total dc link voltage and at the same time capable to exploit the maximum torque capability in whole speed range with good dynamic performance. The proposed solution preserves the simplicity of tuning of the regulators.; Furthermore, in order to validate the effectiveness of presented solution, it is assessed in terms of performance and complexity and compared to two other algorithm presented in literature. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is also tested on induction motor drive fed by a matrix converter.; Another important research area is connected to the development of technology for vehicular applications. In this field the dynamic performances and the low power consumption is one of most important goals for an effective algorithm. Towards this direction, a control scheme for induction motor that integrates within a coherent solution some of the features that are commonly required to an electric vehicle drive is presented. The main features of the proposed control scheme are the capability to exploit the maximum torque in the whole speed range, a weak dependence on the motor parameters, a good robustness against the variations of the dc-link voltage and, whenever possible, the maximum efficiency.; The second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the multi-phase systems. This technology, in fact, is characterized by a number of issues worthy of investigation that make it competitive with other technologies already on the market.; Multiphase systems, allow to redistribute power at a higher number of phases, thus making possible the construction of electronic converters which otherwise would be very difficult to achieve due to the limits of present power electronics.; Multiphase drives have an intrinsic reliability given by the possibility that a fault of a phase, caused by the possible failure of a component of the converter, can be solved without inefficiency of the machine or application of a pulsating torque.; The control of the magnetic field spatial harmonics in the air-gap with order higher than one allows to reduce torque noise and to obtain high torque density motor and multi-motor applications.; In one of the next chapters a control scheme able to increase the motor torque by adding a third harmonic component to the air-gap magnetic field will be presented. Above the base speed the control system reduces the motor flux in such a way to ensure the maximum torque capability. ; The presented analysis considers the drive constrains and shows how these limits modify the motor performance.; The multi-motor applications are described by a well-defined number of multiphase machines, having series connected stator windings, with an opportune permutation of the phases these machines can be independently controlled with a single multi-phase inverter. In this dissertation this solution will be presented and an electric drive consisting of two five-phase PM tubular actuators fed by a single five-phase inverter will be presented.; Finally the modulation strategies for a multi-phase inverter will be illustrated. The problem of the space vector modulation of multiphase inverters with an odd number of phases is solved in different way. An algorithmic approach and a look-up table solution will be proposed. The inverter output voltage capability will be investigated, showing that the proposed modulation strategy is able to fully exploit the dc input voltage either in sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal operating conditions.; All this aspects are considered in the next chapters. In particular, Chapter 1 summarizes the mathematical model of induction motor. The Chapter 2 is a brief state of art on three-phase inverter. Chapter 3 proposes a stator flux vector control for a three- phase induction machine and compares this solution with two other algorithms presented in literature. Furthermore, in the same chapter, a complete electric drive based on matrix converter is presented.

Mabe; Lynn Marie Gravatt; Glenn S. Bushnell; Ephraim Gutmark; Russell DiMicco; Christopher Harris,"Aircraft of all types and sizes would benefit from the development of solid-state electromechanical actuators that eliminate the need for hydraulics and electric motors. The Boeing Company has been actively developing a robust solid state Active Hinge Pin Actuator (AHPA) that can reliably apply high torque and angular displacement with a low space, weight, and power burden. It uses Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) technology adapted and developed into a solid-state actuator. Integrating the active actuator elements into the aircraft structure yields significant savings in size, weight, parts count, and scheduled maintenance. The target application for this study was blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise. Previous research has shown that small tabs on the rotor blades can reduce blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise; in addition, this application demonstrates the integration of a compact, low-cost, reproducible, rugged and efficient torsional actuator that can survive the harsh rotor blade environment. An AHPA was developed that meets the displacement, force, and frequency requirements of a BVI noise reduction tab within acceptable weight and size limits. Two deployment device configurations were built and tested in both a centrifuge and 2D wind tunnel. Results from both tests are presented including mechanical performance of the devices under high centrifugal forces and a brief overview of the aerodynamic effects during wind tunnel tests.",,,,,Wind tunnel; Angular displacement; Engineering; Aerodynamics; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Electric motor; Hinge; Centrifugal force; Structural engineering; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2008-1451,http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2008-1451,,10.2514/6.2008-1451,2318908171,,0,068-435-668-721-503; 096-170-131-849-763,3

Unipolar rectangular signals with different amplitudes of 15 V and 10 V have been used for driving. The attainment of large tilting angles and high frequencies are resulted from the high torque delivered by the thin-film PZT driving layer and mechanical leverage amplification. To study the influence of geometrical parameters on the static and dynamic performance and optimize the designs, FEM simulations have been applied. In order to realize closed-loop actuation one actuator has been used as piezoelectric sensor delivering corresponding feedback signals for position detection.

These systems are of particular interest for tasks involved with the US Department of Energy, where the level of radiation exposure is high and the tasks are highly repetitive. With the hydraulic servo actuators, one is concerned with the issues like the high complexity, cost of the system and the difficulty of maintenance of the system. For high payload operations, the hydraulic systems provide an order of magnitude increase in the power density, which is almost impossible to achieve using the electrical servo actuators. Hence, for the electrical servo actuators to be used for high payload operations, the fundamental issue concerning the power and torque density must be addressed. Previous research conducted on this front suggested the use of a variable speed transmission system to spread the servomotor’s torque-speed characteristics across a wider output speed range. This has the effect of allowing smaller high power motors to also deliver high torques at low speeds. By using a variable speed transmission, the motor size can be reduced dramatically while increasing the overall actuator power density in the process. This work goes further into the detailed design of the discrete variable transmission system. A three-stage planetary gear transmission system is considered for the analysis and design.",,,,,Servo; Servomotor; Transmission system; Hydraulic machinery; Control engineering; Torque; Payload; Actuator; Continuously variable transmission; Computer science,,,,,https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes/2205/ http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3619&context=utk_gradthes,https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes/2205/,,,2164521213,,0,007-300-605-922-075; 010-449-898-647-831; 020-373-677-016-344; 022-113-378-220-70X; 037-692-977-643-644; 051-112-097-592-125; 053-126-633-142-532; 053-772-799-879-258; 082-894-851-096-750; 116-299-310-093-739; 158-387-973-244-175,0

Low speed high torque seawater hydraulic motor as a kind of energy conversion device and actuator plays an important role in seawater hydraulic transmission system. However, the physical and chemical properties of seawater, such as low viscosity, high causticity and poor lubrication, result in numerous problems. In this paper, the flow distribution characteristics of port plate pairs for the seawater hydraulic motor are investigated, and the leakage flow and power loss models of port plate pairs are established. Numerical simulations are carried out to examine the effects of water film, inlet pressure and rotating speed on the pressure distribution and leakage flow. And the friction and wear tests of port plate pairs are also carried out. Moreover, the test system of the seawater hydraulic motor is constructed and the performance of prototype with no-load or loading is conducted. The results indicate that the clearance of port plate pairs and inlet pressure have a significant effect on distribution characteristics, but the effect of rotating speed is not very obvious. The experimental results show that the minimum error rate can be maintained within 0.3% by the proposed flow model and the counter materials of 316L against carbon-fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFRPEEK) are suitable for the port plate pairs of seawater hydraulic motor. Finally, based on the seawater hydraulic experiment platform, the volumetric efficiency of no-load and loading are obtained that the maximum can achieve 94.71% and 90.14%, respectively. This research work may improve the flow distribution performance, lubrication and the friction and wear properties, enhance energy converting efficiency of port plate pair and provide theoretical and technical support for the design of high-performance water hydraulic components.",32,1,1,13,Viscosity; Energy transformation; Actuator; Lubrication; Materials science; Seawater; Marine engineering; Hydraulic motor; Volumetric efficiency; Piston,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Zhejiang Provincial National Natural Science Foundation of China; Hebei Provincial National Natural Science Foundation of China; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s10033-019-0422-y https://cjme.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s10033-019-0422-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10033-019-0422-y,,10.1186/s10033-019-0422-y,2995644723,,0,001-493-229-469-953; 002-091-330-464-836; 004-954-689-018-676; 005-336-786-702-021; 007-552-132-744-715; 010-101-009-177-423; 013-931-733-717-584; 018-168-707-785-191; 019-523-259-398-381; 021-326-690-439-506; 028-515-373-664-440; 029-739-033-947-988; 032-607-815-874-270; 057-772-223-809-850; 060-664-551-398-368; 067-530-574-026-621; 075-195-549-098-249; 077-992-311-014-847; 078-927-641-215-241; 082-344-815-778-045; 086-487-478-888-617; 090-132-881-655-778; 095-019-899-305-220; 098-877-579-844-911; 101-709-368-254-173; 105-061-201-413-95X; 108-352-590-960-226; 112-044-822-118-354; 117-562-763-078-066; 118-165-143-103-213; 124-588-966-053-378; 136-822-865-138-186; 150-899-157-252-255; 155-389-801-511-054; 163-777-772-720-90X; 166-561-955-009-092; 166-891-173-382-863; 170-598-781-226-495; 194-514-491-678-565,2

In practice, an inherent mechanical resonant frequency and a velocity amplitude of USM are changed largely according to operating temperature due to frictional drive, load disturbance torque, and applied voltage levels.

An International Symposium,,IEEE,,J. W. Krome; Jörg Wallaschek,"By appropriate superposition of two standing waves a traveling wave can be excited in the ring-shaped stator of a traveling wave motor. Thus the material points on the surface of the stator perform an elliptical motion. A second disk, pressed against the stator, is driven by frictional forces, generated in the interface between stator and rotor. Traveling wave motors produce a very high torque at low rotational speed. Their simple mechanical design and good controllability make these motors a very promising alternative to small electro-magnetic motors. The mechanical oscillations of high frequency are excited by piezoelectric ceramic actuators, bonded to the surface of the stator. The dynamic behavior of the stator is strongly influenced by these actuators. Since it is very difficult to produce big ceramic rings for large stators and bond them to the stators we tried to excite a large stator using single piezoelectric elements. The geometry of the ceramic actuators as well as the stiffness of the bonding layer do have marked influence on the efficiency of the excitation, because the actuation mechanism is of induced strain type and the stator is excited by tangential stresses in the bonding layer. In this paper the influence of the shape of the ceramics on the vibration of the stator is investigated using the finite element method. A detailed model taking into account the piezoelectric effect in the ceramic actuators as well as the exact geometry of the stator is used to calculate the transfer function between the electrical excitation and the mechanical vibrations of the stator.

Unlike a multi-axes actuating mechanism where the number of electrical inputs typically equal to its number of controllable degrees of freedom, the VRSM offers a large number of distributed electrical inputs as compared to the number of controllable DOF. Since larger number of small coils is used, it not only effectively increases the surface area for heat dissipation, but also allows a small amount of current to flow through each of the coils. This distributed actuation offers an effective means to overcome heat dissipation problems commonly associated with direct-drive actuators for high torque applications. To exploit the advantages offered by this unique feature that provides a greater flexibility in design and control, a good understanding of the key parameters that could significantly influence the motor performance is essential. For this reason, we present in this paper some results of a detailed parametric study on the effects of pole geometry on the thermal and torque performance of a three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) VRSM.",1,,548,553,Distributed parameter system; Parametric statistics; Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Thermal; Geometry; High torque; Spherical motor; Control theory; Flow (psychology),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ram/ram2004.html#LeeWJ04 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1438979/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ramech.2004.1438979,,10.1109/ramech.2004.1438979,2099213257,,0,036-705-219-085-560; 062-086-480-192-581; 100-767-774-383-834; 136-773-531-079-130; 143-700-533-809-260; 183-509-842-401-096,3

Kermani,"In this paper, adaptive compensation of the hysteresis in a Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based actuators and its application for sensor-less high fidelity force/torque control is investigated. The MR actuator considered in this paper was originally described in [1] and [2]. This actuator offers high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios. Yet, as an essential component of MR actuators, the magnetic circuit of the actuator shows hysteresis between its input current/voltage and output magnetic field. The hysteresis in the magnetic circuit results in a similar relationship between the input current and the output torque of the MR actuator. The control scheme used with actuators possessing hysteresis often requires compensating for the hysteresis. To this end, we propose an adaptive control method based on feedback linearization that estimates both hysteresis and uncertain parameters of the magnetic circuit. A set of experiments is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",,,4900,4905,Adaptive control; Direct torque control; Hysteresis; Engineering; Torque; Voltage; Actuator; Magnetic circuit; Control theory; Feedback linearization,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6697063 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6697063 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iros/iros2013.html#YadmellatK13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iros.2013.6697063,,10.1109/iros.2013.6697063,2014585985,,0,005-234-888-101-772; 020-347-633-229-12X; 021-939-345-175-089; 030-395-689-296-021; 030-703-441-659-492; 031-198-973-607-943; 032-529-270-932-432; 033-927-853-470-073; 034-337-381-194-969; 035-861-990-695-571; 038-381-279-325-583; 046-141-380-556-295; 047-881-000-701-885; 048-002-050-280-436; 054-063-411-879-951; 056-490-640-532-539; 056-993-062-615-432; 060-080-559-971-297; 061-053-800-582-486; 063-332-837-575-356; 063-551-301-166-327; 064-148-628-672-308; 068-856-526-933-549; 076-620-239-978-620; 077-799-431-068-95X; 090-593-950-621-523; 099-404-639-227-71X; 102-184-875-655-788; 108-051-099-144-422; 110-011-534-867-058; 117-668-659-164-277; 120-834-516-173-44X; 126-890-654-239-536; 162-238-350-940-225; 179-886-315-358-101; 179-973-821-358-96X,4

Kusuda; M. Takahashi,"Satellitesorbiting the Earthrequirelarge-angle andrapid rotational maneuverability. Controlmoment gyrosare expected to be applied to attitude control actuators of small agile satellites, because control moment gyros can generate high torque effectively. However, the control moment gyro hasa singularity problem that affects its energy consumption and rapid actuation. To solve the problem, a feedforward control logic using an energy-optimal path planned by a Fourier basis algorithm is proposed here. However, this logic alone cannot maintain precise control under actual errors and disturbances. Therefore, a feedback control system was also designed in order to acquire robustness against errors and disturbances.

Reported here are novel results in the analysis of EMFAs with permanent-magnet synchronous motors, with particular interest in the application of brushless high-torque density motors which have superior characteristics compared with other state-of-the-art motor technologies.

The piezoelectric material that is integrated into the horns is pre-stressed with flexures. Piezoelectric actuators are attractive for their ability to generate precision high strokes, torques, and forces while operating under relatively harsh conditions (temperatures at single-digit K to as high as 1,273 K). Electromagnetic motors (EM) typically have high rotational speed and low torque. In order to produce a useful torque, these motors are geared down to reduce the speed and increase the torque. This gearing adds mass and reduces the efficiency of the EM. Piezoelectric motors can be designed with high torques and lower speeds directly without the need for gears. Designs were developed for producing rotary motion based on the Barth concept of an ultrasonic horn driving a rotor. This idea was extended to a linear motor design by having the horns drive a slider. The unique feature of these motors is that they can be designed in a monolithic planar structure. The design is a unidirectional motor, which is driven by eight horn actuators, that rotates in the clockwise direction. There are two sets of flexures. The flexures around the piezoelectric material are pre-stress flexures and they pre-load the piezoelectric disks to maintain their being operated under compression when electric field is applied. The other set of flexures is a mounting flexure that attaches to the horn at the nodal point and can be designed to generate a normal force between the horn tip and the rotor so that to first order it operates independently and compensates for the wear between the horn and the rotor.",,,,,Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Torque; Piezoelectric motor; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Acoustics; Ultrasonic horn; Linear motor; Ultrasonic sensor,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20120000805 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120000805 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/267552,http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20120000805,,,752064563,,0,,2

Regenerative braking, also termed electrical energy regeneration, represents a promising solution to the aforementioned shortcomings. Regenerative braking converts the otherwise dissipated mechanical energy during locomotion into electrical energy for recharging the onboard batteries, while simultaneously providing negative mechanical work for controlled system deceleration. This paper reviewed the electromechanical design and optimization of lower-limb biomechatronic devices with electrical energy regeneration. The technical review starts by examining human walking biomechanics (i.e., mechanical work, power, and torque about the hip, knee, and ankle joints) and proposes general design principles for regenerative braking prostheses and exoskeletons. Analogous to electric and hybrid electric vehicle powertrains, there are numerous mechatronic design components that could be optimized to maximize electrical energy regeneration, including the mechanical power transmission, electromagnetic machine, electrical drive, device mass and moment of inertia, and energy storage devices. Design optimization of these system components is individually discussed while referencing the latest advancements in robotics and automotive engineering. The technical review demonstrated that existing systems (1) are limited to level-ground walking applications and (2) have maximum energy regeneration efficiencies between 30% and 37%. Accordingly, potential future directions for research and innovation include (1) regenerative braking during dynamic movements like sitting down and slope and staircase descent and (2) utilizing high-torque-density electromagnetic machines and low-impedance mechanical power transmissions to maximize energy regeneration efficiencies.</jats:p>",11,4,1,39,Torque; Exoskeleton; Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion; Artificial intelligence; Regenerative brake; Automotive engineering; Mechatronics; Exoskeleton Device; Robotics; Computer science; Energy storage,,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital,http://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2730917 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanismsrobotics/article/11/4/040801/726758/Lower-Limb-Prostheses-and-Exoskeletons-With-Energy https://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2730917,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4043460,,10.1115/1.4043460,2940229279,,0,000-706-855-195-136; 001-108-277-681-322; 002-345-783-836-732; 004-993-435-201-448; 005-834-789-834-072; 007-543-362-277-169; 010-936-464-924-30X; 011-853-945-066-951; 013-004-064-495-883; 014-875-828-098-213; 015-659-118-498-941; 015-747-846-983-62X; 015-796-755-513-56X; 016-426-097-457-014; 017-238-031-663-761; 018-878-513-951-397; 019-231-352-877-737; 019-722-813-678-375; 020-355-868-728-687; 020-778-865-115-687; 021-205-334-332-023; 022-724-785-942-585; 023-695-429-703-605; 023-747-875-393-637; 025-978-537-443-671; 027-970-109-903-914; 029-386-667-802-51X; 030-008-722-268-346; 033-991-747-588-373; 036-261-555-900-160; 038-001-065-352-618; 040-043-478-743-788; 044-097-407-155-232; 044-562-417-608-865; 047-438-497-927-524; 048-221-846-345-231; 049-359-874-997-198; 049-752-148-772-235; 049-777-149-622-977; 051-614-035-217-960; 054-210-583-551-861; 054-405-518-434-474; 054-537-910-840-295; 054-652-529-722-146; 055-783-053-657-663; 056-207-863-528-792; 057-942-436-813-043; 058-257-866-560-032; 059-189-533-359-546; 059-579-998-080-100; 059-605-523-796-718; 061-805-094-205-286; 062-399-636-281-773; 065-564-232-854-139; 065-718-832-824-653; 068-460-520-281-665; 068-790-071-303-647; 070-069-501-661-953; 074-285-464-926-300; 076-356-020-773-938; 077-553-242-127-172; 078-155-878-806-851; 078-457-950-683-977; 079-165-752-195-253; 084-464-151-729-644; 084-845-446-480-523; 090-002-367-655-833; 090-107-930-854-825; 092-093-959-388-037; 093-996-637-417-441; 094-452-236-577-568; 102-443-602-895-368; 103-130-897-702-154; 105-459-039-599-492; 106-385-240-154-409; 107-152-681-906-548; 108-088-556-944-775; 109-482-389-013-843; 113-703-645-482-157; 114-776-604-759-387; 115-936-040-026-255; 119-600-581-681-523; 126-330-889-579-759; 144-375-673-711-003; 145-677-765-972-550; 146-619-449-282-84X; 150-599-054-652-614; 165-102-181-783-21X; 170-134-451-790-207; 172-633-484-764-303,5

In this structural control scheme, simple feedback of the wing twist at a representative span location is used, and the control torque is applied directly to the wing structure. The stabilization mechanism relies on the simple fact that the plunge motion is strongly damped; thus, if the torsional motion can be controlled, the plunge motion can be used to extract energy from the structure. The practical feasibility of implementing such whig twist control schemes depends on the availability of high-torque actuators and relatively stiff torque tubes. The required control torques are of the order of the torque required to twist a typical wing tip section by 1-3 degrees, which is well within the capability of current technology actuators. Because the control systems are simple and robust, involving only the torsional degree of freedom, flutter suppression schemes based on dynamic twist control and may find practical applications in failsafe stability augmentation systems, or in gust load alleviation systems.",,,,,Transonic; Wing twist; Torque; Actuator; Control system; Twist; Flutter; Torsion (mechanics); Computer science; Control theory,,,,,http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1996-1343,http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.1996-1343,,10.2514/6.1996-1343,2327683748,,0,003-455-233-531-292; 035-644-739-050-393; 037-208-061-257-455; 052-126-650-152-277; 061-467-721-430-986; 065-423-889-317-208; 076-215-900-549-273; 078-329-077-866-798; 085-551-203-821-488; 087-525-227-454-815; 089-333-750-467-465; 098-222-460-519-989; 100-641-166-888-018; 101-818-473-670-630; 105-291-880-173-743; 146-290-260-648-974; 173-349-995-453-37X,2

Markov; Steven Manuel; Leslie M. Shor; Susan R. Opalenik; John P. Wikswo; Philip C. Samson,"We describe a simple and reliable fabrication method for producing multiple, manually activated microfluidic control valves in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices. These screwdriver-actuated valves reside directly on the microfluidic chip and can provide both simple on/off operation as well as graded control of fluid flow. The fabrication procedure can be easily implemented in any soft lithography lab and requires only two specialized tools—a hot-glue gun and a machined brass mold. To facilitate use in multi-valve fluidic systems, the mold is designed to produce a linear tape that contains a series of plastic rotary nodes with small stainless steel machine screws that form individual valves which can be easily separated for applications when only single valves are required. The tape and its valves are placed on the surface of a partially cured thin PDMS microchannel device while the PDMS is still on the soft-lithographic master, with the master providing alignment marks for the tape. The tape is permanently affixed to the microchannel device by pouring an over-layer of PDMS, to form a full-thickness device with the tape as an enclosed underlayment. The advantages of these Tape Underlayment Rotary-Node (TURN) valves include parallel fabrication of multiple valves, low risk of damaging a microfluidic device during valve installation, high torque, elimination of stripped threads, the capabilities of TURN hydraulic actuators, and facile customization of TURN molds. We have utilized these valves to control microfluidic flow, to control the onset of molecular diffusion, and to manipulate channel connectivity. Practical applications of TURN valves include control of loading and chemokine release in chemotaxis assay devices, flow in microfluidic bioreactors, and channel connectivity in microfluidic devices intended to study competition and predator/prey relationships among microbes.",12,1,135,144,Soft lithography; Fluidics; Nanotechnology; Actuator; Control valves; Flow control (data); Materials science; Polydimethylsiloxane; Microchannel; Mechanical engineering; Microfluidics,,Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Flow Injection Analysis/instrumentation; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation; Rotation,,NCI NIH HHS (U54 CA113007) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U01 AI061223-05) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U01 AI061223) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U01AI061223) United States; NCI NIH HHS (U54CA113007) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19859812 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10544-009-9368-7 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3742084 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10544-009-9368-7.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10544-009-9368-7,19859812,10.1007/s10544-009-9368-7,2020510629,PMC3742084,1,002-879-203-019-733; 005-358-503-160-902; 005-726-432-349-172; 007-920-898-231-864; 013-912-100-653-10X; 016-499-581-033-659; 018-137-268-838-746; 024-074-543-021-661; 029-414-082-358-607; 038-941-038-608-884; 040-113-983-393-468; 041-174-518-035-222; 043-850-860-170-685; 052-175-357-877-878; 054-474-978-391-806; 056-628-413-750-260; 057-122-274-119-388; 059-154-068-918-153; 063-990-201-661-704; 068-400-759-225-089; 084-628-648-042-010; 084-689-606-025-537; 088-619-252-112-589; 102-404-827-278-262; 102-780-932-373-72X; 106-134-275-595-697; 120-316-387-587-362; 122-018-125-780-143; 130-006-658-998-948; 156-892-578-221-090,12

The robot is inherently stable when all three feet are on the ground due to its tripod stance, but it can still fall down if it trips while taking a step or if unexpected external forces act on it. The unique structure of STriDER makes the simple task of standing up challenging for a number of reasons; the high height of the robot and long limbs require high torque at the actuators due to its large moment arms; the joint configuration and length of the limbs limit the workspace where the feet can be placed on the ground for support; the compact design of the joints allows limited joint actuation motor output torque; three limbs do not allow extra support and stability in the process of standing up. This paper examines four standing up strategies unique to STriDER: three feet, two feet and one foot pushup, and spiral pushup. For all of these standing up strategies, the robot places its feet or foot at desired positions and then pushes the feet against the ground thus, lifting the body upwards. The four pushup methods for standing up were analyzed and evaluated considering the constraints such as, static stability, friction at the feet, kinematic configuration and joint motor torque limits, thus determining the suggested design and operation parameters. The motor torque trends as the robot stands up using pushup methods were investigated and the results from the analysis were validated through experiments.Copyright © 2009 by ASME",,,1003,1015,Longitudinal static stability; Engineering; Tripod (photography); Torque; Actuator; Mobile robot; Kinematics; Simulation; Workspace; Robot,,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings/IDETC-CIE2009/49040/1003/342186 http://www.romela.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Analysis-Synthesis-and-Experiments-of-Standing-Up-Methods-for-a-Tripedal-Robot.pdf http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1650425 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1650425,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/detc2009-86912,,10.1115/detc2009-86912,1982194712,,0,018-060-324-251-657; 029-055-372-773-081; 034-434-603-398-647; 036-828-786-402-50X; 075-995-342-730-417; 149-929-318-020-682; 195-476-665-992-16X,0

By using a simple mechanism in a compact body, this motor can generate high torque. The nutation motor consists of three small linear pneumatic actuators and a gear-reduction mechanism that transforms their motion into rotation of the output shaft. Driving each pneumatic actuator sequentially with pneumatic digital signals results in nutation of the input bevel gear, which causes the output shaft to rotate. In this paper, the structure, working principle, and theoretical characteristics of a pneumatic nutation motor are presented. The design and fabrication of five prototype models and the results of experimental evaluations are also reported in detail. The prototype motors range in size from 10 to 50 mm in diameter and from 11.5 to 49 mm in length. It was found that the torque/volume ratios of the pneumatic nutation motors were about 2-29 times larger than those of a typical conventional electromagnetic geared motor.",14,1,82,92,Engineering; Torque; Pneumatic actuator; Actuator; Electromagnetics; Nutation; Digital signal; Bevel gear; Control theory; Rotation,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4783211/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4783211/ http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000004783211 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.ieee-art-000004783211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2008.2004035,,10.1109/tmech.2008.2004035,2101428302,,0,008-532-818-638-296; 012-719-343-087-56X; 014-304-742-773-186; 020-551-119-167-702; 041-460-982-686-915; 043-719-229-820-355; 044-756-349-402-691; 052-782-112-123-482; 060-624-482-085-782; 070-615-623-322-12X; 080-808-383-081-171; 094-498-922-191-618; 099-682-698-592-194; 153-269-316-166-454; 189-986-294-433-694,20

Dasgupta; A. Mukherjee; Rathindranath Maiti,"<jats:p>In this paper the dynamics of epitrochoid generated Orbital ‘rotary piston machine’ (ROPIMA) type ‘low speed high torque’ (LSHT) hydrostatic unit are studied. The complex variation of the volume of a chamber of such a machine with shaft rotation along with dynamic characteristics of the rotary flow distributor valve, interchamber leakages, fluid compressibility, inertia of orbiting rotor, etc. demand a structured approach to arrive at its mathematical model. In conventional approaches the system morphology gets obscured as the mathematical model is arrived at. Owing to the lack of modularity the errors in deduction of equations may remain eclipsed. Bondgraphs provide a structured approach to model engineering systems. The bondgraph model of the LSHT orbital motor is presented in this work. Relevant simulation results are discussed. The mathematical model was found to be stiff and its integrations were costly and time consuming. A tractable approach to estimate its steady state behavior is suggested and validated. The authors believe that such an approach would be suitable in the initial stages of design of such machines and in the development of control systems where these machines are used as actuators.</jats:p>",118,3,415,421,Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Control system; Epitrochoid; Hydraulic motor; Piston; Mechanical engineering,,,,,http://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432753 https://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432753 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/manufacturingscience/article/118/3/415/434286/Modeling-and-Dynamics-of-Epitrochoid-Generated https://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/manufacturingscience/article-abstract/118/3/415/434286/Modeling-and-Dynamics-of-Epitrochoid-Generated,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.2831046,,10.1115/1.2831046,2023236337,,0,015-577-683-153-103; 025-131-079-756-692; 032-573-102-067-29X; 116-616-956-558-853; 164-427-625-056-101,4

Active micro-vibrations were applied to the eye by using an innovative micro-mechanism based on a tiny stepper motor. The hyperacuity of this inexpensive position-sensing device, which results from the active micro-vibrations, makes it capable of measuring the angular position of a contrasting edge. Among the many miniature rotary actuators available, piezomotors are often used when small size, low mass, great accuracy and high dynamics are required. The newly off-the-shelf miniature ultrasonic piezomotor presented in this study along with its position servo control system is supplied ready-integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB Piezomotor (or PCBMotor) has many advantages, such as high torque (it requires no reducer), fast dynamics (the mechanical time constant is 3ms), a low mass (1gram) and a compact size (it is only 20mm in diameter and 2.6mm thick). The results of the tests conducted show that the performances of the PCBmotor connected to a custom-made miniature electronic driver make it a good alternative to the actuators classically used in robotic applications. In addition we present a simple visual processing, implemented onto a tiny microcontroller, composed of simple linear filtering and arithmetic operations.

In development of high-efficiency actuators, use of high magnetic flux density designs can assist high torque, weight reduction and size down. It is therefore very important to understand the magnetic properties under high magnetic flux conditions in the electric steel sheets. However, there are still some difficulties in the measurements, due to nonlinearity and anisotropy of magnetic materials. The measured magnetic power losses of the clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating fields become different for magnetic flux density over 1.2 T and the value in counter-clockwise case sometimes became negative. It can be considered that angle errors of H and B-coils are the main reasons of the measurement errors. In this paper, the angle errors of the double B-coil (search coils) and the double H-coil (cross-type H-coil) are evaluated with a calibration device, which consists of a special solenoid coil and a high-precision turntable. The magnetic properties are compensated with the measured angle errors.",127,4,159,164,Electromagnet; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Magnetic flux; Magnetic energy; Magnetic reactance; Magnetic core; Magnetic circuit; Acoustics; Magnetic pressure; Search coil,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007IJTFM.127..159M/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1541/ieejfms.127.159,,10.1541/ieejfms.127.159,2001055169,,0,129-961-727-228-964,2

International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics : [proceedings],19457901; 19457898,,United States,Shiqian Wang; Wietse van Dijk; Herman van der Kooij,"An exoskeleton has to be lightweight, compliant, yet powerful to fulfill the demanding task of walking. This imposes a great challenge for the actuator design. Electric motors, by far the most common actuator in robotic, orthotic, and prosthetic devices, cannot provide sufficiently high peak and average power and force/torque output, and they normally require high-ratio, heavy reducer to produce the speeds and high torques needed for human locomotion. Studies on the human muscle-tendon system have shown that muscles (including tendons and ligaments) function as a spring, and by storing energy and releasing it at a proper moment, locomotion becomes more energy efficient. Inspired by the muscle behavior, we propose a novel actuation strategy for exoskeleton design. In this paper, the collected gait data are analyzed to identify the spring property of the human muscle-tendon system. Theoretical optimization results show that adding parallel springs can reduce the peak torque by 66%, 53%, and 48% for hip flexion/extension (F/E), hip abduction/adduction (A/A), and ankle dorsi/plantar flexion (D/PF), respectively, and the rms power by 50%, 45%, and 61%, respectively. Adding a series spring (forming a Series Elastic Actuator, SEA) reduces the peak power by 79% for ankle D/PF, and by 60% for hip A/A. A SEA does not reduce the peak power demand at other joints. The optimization approach can be used for designing other wearable robots as well.",2011,,1,6,Engineering; Torque; Exoskeleton; Gait; Actuator; Gait analysis; Electric motor; Reducer; Ankle; Simulation,,"Adult; Ankle Joint/physiology; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Gait/physiology; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal/physiology; Orthotic Devices; Robotics/instrumentation; Spinal Cord Injuries/rehabilitation; Walking/physiology; Young Adult",,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005975471 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5975471/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22275669 https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/spring-uses-in-exoskeleton-actuation-design https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Fcf9c23c3-749d-42cd-99fe-b250aa8463fa https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5975471/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icorr.2011.5975471,22275669,10.1109/icorr.2011.5975471,2137264985,,1,004-470-964-220-158; 021-309-431-058-018; 023-360-950-534-182; 031-134-550-557-080; 034-809-557-894-17X; 043-798-162-884-255; 049-331-219-757-150; 049-632-583-899-357; 074-133-060-140-974; 080-203-488-764-946; 097-297-095-863-430; 097-445-109-979-787; 115-806-354-740-309; 126-341-581-863-511; 132-259-543-512-117; 150-599-054-652-614,51

This paper presents such a robotic system that allows for two working modes, the robot-active mode and human-active mode. The robot is designed to be equipped with magnetorheological (MR) actuators that have the advantages of high torque, fast response, flexible controllability, low power consumption and safety guarantee. The design and characteristics of the MR actuator are introduced. In the robot-active mode, the MR actuator works as a clutch to transfer the torque to the robotic joint safely. In the human-active mode, the MR actuator functions as a brake to provide resistance to help strengthen muscles. The working mode is determined by the human motion intention, which is detected via the skin surface electromyography (EMG) signals. The human-robot interaction torques are estimated using the EMG-driven impedance model. The biomechanical analysis based on AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) is used to help optimization. Then, an adaptive control method is proposed to realize the assist-as-needed (AAN) training strategy, where the robot can switch between these two modes.

As to resonant motors, travelling wave motors, either rotary or lineal must be highlighted. These devices have several features that make them different as compared to any other type of piezoelectric devices. In general, they are comparatively more complex since they include intermittent contact problems between solids, synchronized oscillations in perpendicular axes, and excitation close to the resonance. All these features have limited the application of this kind of actuators, even though some functional characteristics, as noiseless operation, high torque range and their compact construction have made them suitable for several applications. On the other hand, piezoelectric actuators with forced excitation, due to their non-existence movement amplification in the resonance, have been used in applications where an ultra-accurate positioning is required with intermediate levels of force. Lineal multilayer and cyclic actuators must be identified as classical forced actuators. The aim of this paper is to summarize, analyzing the main features of the resonant and forced actuators, the applications where this type of motors will be used in the future.

Considerable torque density improvement can be achieved by supplying the windings with current greater than the rated value and thus thermally overloading the machine for short periods of time. However, if the insulation is overheated, the machine lifetime is shortened, and reliability issues can arise. This paper experimentally investigates the influence of short-time thermal overload on the insulation lifetime of low voltage, random wound electrical machines. The analysis is performed on round enamelled magnet wires coils aged by accelerated thermal cycles, and the results are statistically processed by the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The experimental data is also used for building a lifetime estimation model, which is employed for predicting the lifetime of a motor embedded into an electromechanical actuator for landing gear extension/retraction.",,,1,6,Low voltage; Magnet; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Weibull distribution; Electric motor; Materials science; Duty cycle; Torque density; Electromagnetic coil,,,,,https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/720791,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/esars-itec.2018.8607539,,10.1109/esars-itec.2018.8607539,2909068836,,0,000-464-820-523-065; 001-280-752-284-794; 004-619-443-857-375; 016-418-815-983-749; 018-156-354-470-11X; 019-030-186-710-307; 020-007-728-461-748; 023-498-548-774-737; 026-340-770-123-555; 031-549-425-734-29X; 033-402-943-118-872; 041-381-633-315-31X; 044-848-381-885-767; 052-018-870-635-213; 054-703-880-919-285; 064-030-591-961-080; 064-802-505-757-751; 069-477-201-814-222; 082-946-555-447-28X; 088-926-140-244-747; 091-939-610-101-371; 098-668-231-137-529; 115-000-251-602-859; 118-632-212-511-756; 122-003-562-347-434; 122-518-092-452-282; 124-322-895-038-737; 124-477-517-008-932; 162-648-225-493-085; 190-488-698-088-026,11

The change in these ratios depends passively on the load, in contrast to the continuous variable transmission (CVT), where the transmission ratio is controlled explicitly. Another difference from the CVT is that the PVT is elastic and the term transmission ratio is therefore not applicable. A theory section formulates alternative ways of describing the torque and velocity relations for elastic conservative transmisions as well as other important properties.; ; This theory is used to analyze and illustrate the characteristics of a PVT. The theory is also used to compare the PVT with another novel elastic conservative transmission, called load sensitive CVT.; ; The nonlinearities and elasticity of the PVT make it difficult to control using linear control theory. Feedback linearization was therefore used to design a torque controller, and experimental results show low impedance at small loads. Further, the controller tracks a reference torque well as long as the reference rate does not cause motor saturation. The abilities of the PVT are also illustrated by comparing it with an actuator having a traditional transmission. The load case is recorded joint torques and angles from the carpus joint of a walking horse. Simulation show that the required peak power is reduced by more than 20% and the product of the maximum torque and the maximum angular velocity is reduced by approximately 30%.",25,10,1013,1032,Elasticity (economics); Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Continuously variable transmission; Transmission (mechanics); Angular velocity; Control theory; Control theory; Feedback linearization,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364906069188 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijrr/ijrr25.html#IngvastWR06 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364906069188 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364906069188 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:14571,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0278364906069188,,10.1177/0278364906069188,2003862783,,0,016-753-744-018-295; 026-415-542-886-327; 034-086-692-633-048; 037-205-802-861-390; 054-523-154-954-90X; 055-430-568-371-329; 055-663-723-455-088; 079-437-648-339-532; 093-906-634-584-525; 120-466-912-857-847; 153-702-053-587-605; 158-005-225-479-693,14

Magnetorheological (MR) brakes are used as actuators in haptics since they provide high torque-to-volume ratios. However, they still tend to be rather large and use high current inputs. We developed a new MR-brake with a T-rotor and serpentine flux path. The new device has 45 mm diameter and 65 mm length. It produces 6.5 Nm torque with 1A current input. It has more than double the torque-to-volume ratio of a commercial MR-brake and a previous T-rotor brake in literature. As such, it can open up many new application areas including portable systems. A prototype was built and tested to assess its effectiveness as a 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) haptic device in virtual wall collision.

II. 뱀 로봇 설계 본 연구에서 개발된 뱀 로봇, KAEROT-snake IV는 이전에 개발된 뱀 로봇, KAEROT-snake III 보다 소형이면서 향상된 기능을 갖도록 개발되었다. KAEROT-snake III는 상용 1 자유도 RC 서보 두 개를 직각으로 배치하여 만든 2 자유도 작동기 모듈로 개발하여 3차원 공간을 이동할 수 있도록 하였다[12]. KAEROT-snake III은 외경이 80mm이며 수동바퀴 없이 이동하고, 전복되지 않도록",17,7,697,703,Snake-arm robot; Actuator; High torque; 3d space; Computer science; Control theory; Robot,,,,,http://koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=JOJDCV_2011_v17n7_697,http://dx.doi.org/10.5302/j.icros.2011.17.7.697,,10.5302/j.icros.2011.17.7.697,2142886611,,0,018-046-866-779-05X; 030-220-863-928-908; 037-168-474-714-34X; 051-051-568-683-941; 074-741-226-463-327; 084-447-777-472-794; 097-639-987-112-808; 157-802-791-222-644,2

Izuno; R. Takeda; Mutsuo Nakaoka,"A high-performance servo control scheme using compact ultrasonic motors (USMs) as actuators has not yet been practically realized in modern industry and office automation systems because the dynamic and steady-state modeling of USMs is almost impossible from a theoretical point of view. A high-performance speed/positional servo control scheme based on modern fuzzy reasoning concepts and featuring a traveling wave-type USM with high torque at low speed range is presented. The control method of the USM servo system using inverter frequency and voltage control strategies for the speed and amplitude of the traveling wave on the USM stator and the phase difference control scheme between two-phase high-frequency inverters are demonstrated and evaluated using experimental results. In particular, the control implementation is described from a practical viewpoint. >",28,3,613,618,Servomotor; Engineering; Control engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Digital control; Stator; Machine control; Servo control; Servomechanism; Fuzzy logic; Control theory,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/137447/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/28.137447,,10.1109/28.137447,2098554216,,0,029-315-782-891-652; 037-423-792-391-123; 088-838-236-283-388; 162-728-052-439-020,51

Cao; Jörg Wallaschek,"Travelling wave ultrasonic motors are a new type of small scale actuators. They have been attracting considerable attention in industry because of their unique characteristics such as high torque, low speed, compact size, silence and good controllability. The stator/rotor contact in such motors displays inherently non-linear dynamic characteristics which are most important for understanding and designing the motor performance [1,3]. In this paper two stator/rotor contact models, an analytical model and a finite element model, have been used in the investigation of the dynamic contact problem. As an analytical model, a visco-elastic foundation model was developed, which is capable of predicting the tangential velocity fields and tangential stress distributions of the stator/rotor interface and simulating the stick/slip phenomena in contact areas. The influence of main material and geometrical parameters of the motor and different operating conditions have been investigated. The stator/rotor contact models and the analysis methods presented in this paper provide a general approach for modelling travelling wave ultrasonic motors as well as a design tool for optimizing motor performance with the flexibility of allowing for a wide variety of geometries and materials.",76,,93,94,Finite element method; Ultrasonic motor; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Electric motor; Stator; Computer science; Controllability; Computer simulation; Mechanical engineering,,,,,,,,,2513911255,,0,,11

The common decentralized strategy to control the driving velocities and wheel orientations leads to unnecessary high torques, an increased energy consumption as well as additional slippage due to the redundant actuation. This paper introduces a novel model-based control concept that overcomes these. It uses a minimal set of control variables within a PD control law to avoid counteractions. An additional inverse dynamics solution complements the control and further reduces slippage. The resulting generalized torque demand is optimal distributed among the drives. The paper additionally shows how the control performance can be further improved by an additional experiment which identify the inertia parameters of the vehicle.

People who are aged and disabled are meant to be idle in their respective places. This has become the major and initial cause of decubitis ulcer, what we call bed sore. So, we have came up with an idea of preventing such sores that are caused because of the immobility of people. We can prevent such sores by providing a even blood circulation throughout the body. This can be achieved only through bodily movements of patients who are elderly and disabled. So, a blood flow equalizing bed will be very much useful to those decubitus ulcer victims and bed ridden patients. This blood flow equalizing bed will provide automatic physiotherapic movements to those patients by changing the positions of bed and thereby the prevention of such sores can be very much achieved. The change in position of bed is done with linear actuators connected to bed which are driven by DC motors providing high torque.

We propose the use of CMGs in actuating joint degrees of freedom in a spacecraft-mounted agile coelostat telescope, whose tasks include acquiring and tracking a high-speed target. High agility, on the order of several radians per second, is a priority for such a system; however, such capabilities are achieved with traditional actuators only at the expense of excessively high electrical power. The proposed design provides reactionless, agile slewing of a telescope for a small fraction of the power required by fixed rotors in a reaction wheel assembly.

Progress in that direction was made by introducing compliant elements into the actuation. A large variety of actuators were developed such as series elastic actuators (SEAs), variable stiffness actuators and parallel elastic actuators (PEAs). SEAs can reduce the peak power while PEAs can reduce the torque requirement on the motor. Nonetheless, these actuators still cannot meet performances close to humans. To combine both advantages, the series parallel elastic actuator (SPEA) was developed. The principle is inspired from biological muscles. Muscles are composed of motor units, placed in parallel, which are variably recruited as the required effort increases. This biological principle is exploited in the SPEA, where springs (layers), placed in parallel, can be recruited one by one. This recruitment is performed by an intermittent mechanism. This paper presents the development of a SPEA using the MACCEPA principle with a self-closing mechanism. This actuator can deliver a bi-directional output torque, variable stiffness and reduced friction. The load on the motor can also be reduced, leading to a lower power consumption. The variable recruitment of the parallel springs can also be tuned in order to further decrease the consumption of the actuator for a given task. First, an explanation of the concept and a brief description of the prior work done will be given. Next, the design and the model of one of the layers will be presented. The working principle of the full actuator will then be given. At the end of this paper, experiments showing the electric consumption of the actuator will display the advantage of the SPEA over an equivalent stiff actuator.",11,1,016005,016005,Computer Aided Design; Engineering; Torque; Artificial intelligence; Biomimetics; Actuator; Work (physics); Robotics; Transducer; Control theory; Series and parallel circuits,,"Animals; Biomimetics/instrumentation; Computer-Aided Design; Elastic Modulus/physiology; Electric Power Supplies; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Humans; Muscle Contraction/physiology; Muscle, Skeletal/physiology; Robotics/instrumentation; Stress, Mechanical; Transducers",,European Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/display/86186607 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26813145 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016BiBi...11a6005F/abstract https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/11/1/016005 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26813145 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/11/1/016005/pdf https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/168324 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26813145/ https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F168324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-3190/11/1/016005,26813145,10.1088/1748-3190/11/1/016005,2288179771,,0,002-706-294-564-538; 003-217-059-751-72X; 004-078-244-390-320; 012-859-445-279-065; 023-600-685-608-653; 023-651-063-695-617; 025-075-750-167-437; 027-043-942-434-540; 035-702-041-274-451; 037-254-827-564-270; 043-798-162-884-255; 049-564-689-426-126; 051-254-507-568-050; 063-119-652-443-928; 070-643-489-370-355; 077-490-537-453-21X; 077-679-102-627-136; 083-866-989-739-534; 093-952-951-140-159; 098-417-320-183-088; 111-935-217-527-451; 125-569-817-686-190; 138-417-933-328-621; 146-255-672-295-059; 150-599-054-652-614; 186-896-502-212-338,8

Shahed,"Turbo diesel engine use in passenger cars in Europe has resulted in 30-50% improvement in fuel economy. Diesel engine application is particularly suitable for US because of vehicle size and duty cycle patterns. Adopting this technology for use in the US presents two issues--emissions and driveability. Emissions reduction technology is being well addressed with advanced turbocharging, fuel injection and catalytic aftertreatment systems One way to address driveability is to eliminate turbo lag and increase low speed torque. Electrically assisted turbocharging concepts incorporated in e-Turbo{trademark} designs do both The purpose of this project is to design and develop an electrically assisted turbocharger, e-Turbo{trademark}, for diesel engine use in the US. In this report, early design and development of electrical assist technology is described together with issues and potential benefits. In this early phase a mathematical model was developed and verified. The model was used in a sensitivity study. The results of the sensitivity study together with the design and test of first generation hardware was fed into second generation designs. In order to fully realize the benefits of electrical assist technology it was necessary to expand the scope of work to include technology on the compressor side as well as electronic controls concepts. The results of the expanded scope of work are also reported here. In the first instance, designs and hardware were developed for a small engine to quantify and demonstrate benefits. The turbo size was such that it could be applied in a bi-turbo configuration to an SUV sized V engine. Mathematical simulation was used to quantify the possible benefits in an SUV application. It is shown that low speed torque can be increased to get the high performance expected in US, automatic transmission vehicles. It is also shown that e-Turbo{trademark} can be used to generate modest amounts of electrical power and supplement the alternator under most load-speed conditions. It is shown that a single (large) e-Turbo{trademark} consumes slightly less electrical power for the same steady state torque shaping than a bi-Turbo configuration. However, the transient response of a bi-Turbo configuration is slightly better. It was shown that in order to make full use of additional capabilities of e-Turbo{trademark} wide compressor flow range is required. Variable geometry compressor (VGC) technology developed under a separate project was evaluated for incorporation into e-Turbo{trademark} designs. It was shown that the combination of these two technologies enables very high torque at low engine speeds. Designs and hardware combining VGC and e-Turbo{trademark} are to be developed in a future project. There is concern about high power demands (even though momentary) of e-Turbo{trademark}. Reducing the inertia of the turbocharger can reduce power demand and increase battery life. Low inertia turbocharger technology called IBT developed under a separate project was evaluated for synergy with e-Turbo{trademark} designs. It was concluded that inertial reduction provided by IBT is very beneficial for e-Turbo{trademark}. Designs and hardware combining IBT and e-Turbo{trademark} are to be developed in a future project. e-Turbo{trademark} provides several additional flexibilities including exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for emissions reduction with minimum fuel economy penalty and exhaust temperature control for aftertreatment. In integrated multi-parameter control system is needed to realize the full potential of e-Turbo{trademark} performance. Honeywell expertise in process control systems involving hundreds of sensors and actuators was applied to demonstrate the potential benefits of multi-parameter, model based control systems.",,,,,Exhaust gas recirculation; Engineering; Automotive engineering; Turbocharger; Alternator; Trademark; Diesel engine; Electric power; Simulation; Fuel efficiency; Alternator (automotive),,,,,https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc878509/ https://core.ac.uk/display/71306164 https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/910121 https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc878509/m2/1/high_res_d/910121.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/910121,,10.2172/910121,1871235507,,0,,11

In particular, a preliminary analysis evaluates the economic impact for the navigation company of the periodical maintenance related to the keeping of the vessel in dry dock. The study demonstrated that the main critical points are focused on the fragility of the stabilization control system. The increasing of operating costs has motivated the realization of a study aimed at redesigning the stabilization system. The continuing failure of the stabilization system (usually in water-immersed) severely limits the use of the high-speed craft. The proposed design solution considers the positioning of the control actuators of the flaps inside the hull. Therefore, a kinematic system constituted by a slider-crank mechanism that is driven by a double-acting hydraulic cylinder positioned above the waterline was studied and developed. In order to design the mechanical system, it was necessary to take into account of the critical factors related to the transmission of high torque loads with limited space available for the placement of the system components. In fact, in order to reduce the motion resistance and to optimize the hydrodynamic flows in the connection area of the wings to the central strut, it was necessary to design a double cardan joint of reduced radial dimension. Several numerical analyses conducted in ANSYS environment allowed to validate the proposed solution.

The first ultrasonic motor, applied in practice, is a rotational traveling-type ultrasonic motor, made in Japan in 1986. Thereafter, motors with various driving principles have been developed. The ultrasonic motors have a lot of special features, such as: high torque at low velocity, high torque per unit weight and etc. They can be used autonomous in driving, without being assembled with mechanical system of reductions. However, it is difficult to reduce their body-size and it is not possible to be incorporated into lot of precision devices. An ultrasonic motor, which combines a piezoelectric element with a metallic plate, is created by the authors. Characteristics of this motor are simple structure and possibility to expand the displacement of the piezoelectric element. As a result, the rotational velocity is bigger than the driving with the conventional motors, and its expansion gives a possibility to reduce the body-size of the motor, since it is possible to incorporate a small size PZT. For this reason, the study is focused on ultrasonic motor with a flat-type metallic plate. In this sudy, an ultrasonic motor having a curve-shaped metallic plate is introduced. The reason for change of the metallic plate shape from flat into to the curve ones is that the displacement expansion ratio will increase. The stator has a @iezoelectric element and a curve-shaped metallic plate in series. When a driving signal is input into the piezoelectric element, the voltage causes a stretch of the piezoelectric element into longitudinal direction. The extension pushes the metallic plate, which results in bending of the metallic plate. The result of this is that the plate obtains an oblique  shape. Bt using the ratio between the stretching displacement of the piezoelectric element and the oblique direction displacement of the metallic plate, is obtained the incensement of rotation velocity. In the previous article, experimental results of the concrete radius (r5) type curve-shaped metallic plate were shown. Inthis work, the results of the realized driving of the type with curve-shaped metallic plate having radius (r18) are compared with the corresponding results of the ultrasonic motor having a conventional stators (flat-type, r5 type). In the future studies, an application into precision devices that combines the new ultrasonic motor with the power transmission mechanism will be discussed.",,,,,Piezoelectricity; Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Piezoelectric motor; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Acoustics; Stator; Angular velocity; Structural engineering; Bending,,,,,http://nctam.imbm.bas.bg/index.php/nctam/13nctam/paper/view/621/0,http://nctam.imbm.bas.bg/index.php/nctam/13nctam/paper/view/621/0,,,2619180150,,0,,0

Piezoelectric bimorphs are used as actuator elements, and quasistatic positioning in combination with an inchworm type of repetition produces the rotation. The performance of a macroscopic prototype has been investigated and compared with an analytical model and with finite-element analysis. The agreement between the model and the prototype is good, and it is believed that the characteristics of a microsized active joint can be estimated from the analytical model. The difference in size between the prototype and the proposed micromotor is a factor of 100. A micromotor is expected to have a very high torque-to-volume ratio (3 kN m −2 ). Its power and speed limits are believed to be sufficient for an operational micromotor. Other characteristics that make it well suited for microrobotics are: no gliding contact causing wear, simple design and locked rotor when the voltage is turned off.

We developed a high-efficiency compact cycloidal reducer for legged robots that uses needle roller bearings in all parts where contact occurs during the power transfer process inside the reducer, which greatly improves the efficiency compared to a cycloidal reducer using free rollers. We also proposed a subcarrier structure that distributes the load and allows the cycloidal reducer to respond robustly to impacts that may occur during the locomotion of the legged robot.

Addressing the limited control performance of PAMs, we proposed a hybrid actuation scheme that combines PAMs (macro) and a low-inertia DC motor (mini). While the scheme has shown significantly improved control performance and robot safety, a small DC motor has difficulties in handling the large stored energies of the PAMs, particularly for large changes in initial load due to PAM failure. In order to further improve robot safety, we develop a new hybrid actuation scheme with PAMs (macro) and a particle brake (mini). This design allows for a higher torque-to-weight ratio and inherently stable energy dissipation. Addressing optimal mini actuation selection between a motor and a brake, and a control strategy for PAMs and a brake, we conducted comparative studies of hybrid actuations with (1) a DC motor and (2) a brake for concept validation. Experimental comparisons show that the hybrid actuation with PAMs and a brake provides higher energy efficiency for control bandwidths under 2 Hz, and more effective reduction of large impact forces due to the brake's high torque capacity and passive energy dissipation.",33,4,507,518,Engineering; Dissipation; Mechanism design; Artificial intelligence; Efficient energy use; Pneumatic artificial muscles; Brake; Robotics; Control theory; DC motor; Robot,,,,,http://doi.org/10.1177/0278364913509858 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijrr/ijrr33.html#ShinYK14 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364913509858 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1177/0278364913509858 https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364913509858 http://hcr.cau.ac.kr/pages/paper/hybrid.pdf http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364913509858,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0278364913509858,,10.1177/0278364913509858,2152738005,,0,007-322-141-702-193; 011-831-640-027-727; 015-601-016-183-314; 020-909-405-176-064; 021-526-914-441-311; 022-283-915-605-763; 034-337-381-194-969; 037-185-483-971-377; 038-469-627-411-75X; 043-798-162-884-255; 049-743-117-701-990; 049-856-786-981-791; 053-384-244-849-392; 055-430-568-371-329; 064-061-906-449-412; 065-353-154-819-193; 066-284-442-071-976; 071-165-174-360-788; 079-438-683-896-523; 090-151-516-102-909; 101-252-728-305-257; 105-676-068-858-810; 108-619-705-631-802; 110-966-459-250-382; 116-748-975-116-043; 124-774-064-329-725; 125-395-551-771-04X; 170-410-824-464-171,10

Its favourable properties such as high repeatability, high torque capacity, low mass of inertia and high degree of efficiency are proved applied in different applications for semiconductor manufacturing, measuring machines, aerospace and other industries. However for high precise assembly applications often linear adjustments of a few nanometres are required. The common solution for positioning in the nanometres range is the use of piezoelectric effect actuators. The drawbacks are the need for a closed loop control system, overshooting during positioning, local wear, short travel ranges and loss of position without power supply. To overcome these obstacles the advantages of the Micro Harmonic Drive are exploited together with a stepper motor, an eccentric drive and monolithic flexure hinges are combined in a compact unit, called Nanostage. With this setup a travel range of 40 microns and a resolution < 3 nm is achieved. The single sided and double sided repeatability was measured in an open loop control system with < 5 nm and < 10 nm respectively.",,,257,263,Piezoelectricity; Inertia; Engineering; Repeatability; Open-loop controller; Actuator; Electronic engineering; Harmonic drive; Leaf spring; Semiconductor device fabrication; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-77405-3_25 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-77405-3_25 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ifip5-5/ipas2008.html#StaigerD08 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-0-387-77405-3_25.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-77405-3_25,,10.1007/978-0-387-77405-3_25,1553662461,,0,046-481-261-933-220; 082-798-087-678-105; 099-268-253-029-872; 176-127-862-414-671,1

Catunda,"The possibility of using Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) has been currently studied in development of actuators and thermoelectric motors. Generally, these devices use the SMA characteristics of high strain or force capability to produce the displacement and, in this case, the displacement is produced by supplying heat to the actuator element. Their applications are still limited to low speed, but, with the possibility of high torques. When they are used as a thermoelectric motor, the development of a suitable instrumentation becomes indispensable to drive and measure the electrical parameters and the motor motion. Based on that need, this paper presents the electronic instrumentation to characterize a thermoelectric motor grounded on shape changes in shape memory alloys. The prototype of the motor has been built using mini SMA springs as active elements. The geometry of the motor and the spring support base have been developed in ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) polymer. A current amplifier circuit was designed to generate heat and, consequently, produce the motor displacement. The circuit was switched for pulse width modulation (PWM), which has produced the heating by Joule effect. The image technique has been used with a camera placed on the rotor shaft and the SMA actuator, for the strain and displacement measurement. A load cell has been used for the force measurement and a thermocouple for the temperature measurement, both properly conditioned. The electrical current and the potential difference have been measured on it, and so, the electrical resistance variation of the actuator was obtained. Thus, in order to consolidate the thermoelectric motor characterization, results of electrical resistance, force and displacement are presented as a function of heating temperature on the actuators. Furthermore, results of force related to strain and the motor shaft rotation in the time domain are also shown.",,,1,5,Electrical engineering; Torque; Load cell; Thermocouple; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Shape-memory alloy; Thermoelectric effect; Medicine; DC motor; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/i2mtc/i2mtc2017.html#SobrinhoCSSSC17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/i2mtc.2017.7969933,,10.1109/i2mtc.2017.7969933,2735397422,,0,012-811-496-853-415; 033-721-189-989-980; 039-324-712-143-242; 062-440-961-596-412,2

However, the evaluation of the kinematic redundancy as a good solution to increase the dynamic performance was not studied. Kinematic redundancy corresponds to the introduction of an actuator in a kinematic chain. Due to this redundancy, the mechanism can reconfigure itself in order to avoid high torque levels. This can be generally achieved in two different manners: the offline and the online ways. The former manner is the simplest way to use redundancy since the position/orientation of the redundant actuator is modified before the desired trajectory is performed. This position/orientation is selected according to performance indexes via an optimization problem. The latter manner exploits the full capacity of the redundant actuators updating their position/orientation while the trajectory is being performed. The online optimization is implemented in two different methods: the simple online optimizes only the positions and the complex online optimizes the accelerations and positions of the redudant actuator. In order to evaluate these strategies, three kinematically redundant configurations of the 3RRR planar manipulator have been evaluated through kinematic and dynamic models: the (P)RRR+2RRR, the 2(P)RRR+RRR and the 3(P)RRR. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the different levels of redundancy to design high performance parallel manipulators. Moreover, comparisons between the online and offline reconfiguration strategies have been done demonstrating a reduction on the required actuation forces.",,,31,36,Control reconfiguration; Engineering; Control engineering; Trajectory; Optimization problem; Parallel manipulator; Redundancy (engineering); Actuator; Kinematics; Kinematic chain; Control theory,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractKeywords.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=7024092 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2763589.2763868 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/7008826/7019569/07024092.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/sbr.lars.robocontrol.2014.32,,10.1109/sbr.lars.robocontrol.2014.32,2046257992,,0,016-447-053-569-359; 034-140-537-874-495; 039-783-791-946-133; 061-832-188-480-178; 104-449-603-629-694; 138-895-443-067-12X; 146-283-987-238-129,8

The ESEM includes a series elastic manipulator (SEM), an adjustable stiffness mechanism (ASM), and an electrohydraulic servo system (EHS). Thus, the ESEM can benefit from the advantages of the EHS, such as high-power density and a high torque-to-weight ratio. Besides, the ESEM system can use the advantages of the VSA to give the system a suitable dynamic in unknown environments as well as low energy consumption for cyclic tasks. The proposed VSA adjusts the stiffness by changing the position of the springs along the ball screw. This system can provide fast stiffness regulation in a much broader range. However, the variant characteristics of the VSA, and nonlinearities and uncertainties in the EHS, such as friction, leakages, and dependence of bulk modulus on temperature, are major challenges for the control design. The new design of a backstepping adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (BAFSMC) is addressed in this study. It is developed via sliding mode control, backstepping technique, and an adaptive fuzzy scheme. The controller is separated into two control loops for the mechanical dynamics and the hydraulic dynamics. The SMC is embedded for each loop to reduce the system's order and to ensure that the system's state variables reach and stay on the sliding surface. The adaptive fuzzy scheme is used to replace the robust term in the control effort of the conventional SMC to get rid of the chattering phenomenon and to deal with uncertainties in the mechanical and hydraulic subsystems. The Lyapunov approach and backstepping technique are used to prove the robustness and stability of the controlled system and to derive the adaptive laws. On the other hand, a fuzzy input shaping (FIS) scheme which combines an input shaping technique (IST) and a fuzzy logic system, was proposed to minimize the residual vibration at the end effector robustly over the expected operating range of the VSA system. Numerical experiments and comparisons with some existing algorithms are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and show the efficiency of the proposed controller.",52,,22,35,State variable; Ball screw; Input shaping; Robust control; Sliding mode control; Computer science; Fuzzy logic; Control theory; Backstepping; Control theory,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415818300631 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415818300631#!,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.04.004,,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.04.004,2802966721,,0,000-620-036-256-081; 004-078-244-390-320; 007-793-160-127-260; 008-277-296-769-591; 008-704-701-204-054; 009-733-231-739-108; 014-464-967-563-908; 017-323-436-571-212; 021-511-421-511-076; 026-276-398-132-485; 026-947-947-331-925; 027-484-425-018-091; 027-778-515-836-26X; 028-353-929-487-939; 031-253-079-544-078; 032-713-239-856-670; 037-238-016-938-144; 049-502-047-175-456; 054-523-154-954-90X; 055-430-568-371-329; 059-547-226-617-370; 062-642-297-554-948; 072-071-994-224-30X; 082-805-660-680-332; 087-689-972-059-525; 089-733-293-756-626; 093-316-769-572-855; 100-196-860-057-596; 104-991-291-421-404; 113-559-631-891-140; 114-158-538-380-038; 123-156-453-295-384; 124-431-475-441-258; 143-926-688-974-81X; 153-983-795-503-275; 156-975-925-791-666; 159-600-931-725-68X; 161-550-886-682-148; 187-112-400-551-513,8

Due to the fact that such robots need to support their own weight, their actuators need to be light weight, compact and efficient. Furthermore, a dynamics analysis, shows that the actuators' design may have significant impact on a robot's dynamics sensitivity. These consideration motivate improvements in all actuator design aspects. First, the application-specific design of outer rotor motors with concentrated windings is considered. It is shown that an intrinsic design trade-off exists between a motor's copper loss, core loss and mass, which allows development of motors with superior performance for a particular application. The three main application categories of interest are: electric vehicles, drones and robotic joints. Due to their outstanding torque density, high pole count outer rotor motors are analysed in terms of their design and optimization for robotic applications. Motor design scaling modes are also described in order to outline the main challenges in the implementation of high torque motors. Next, the design of gearboxes for robotic actuation is discussed. A novel type of high reduction Bearingless Planetary Gearbox is introduced which allows large range of reduction ratios to be achieved in a compound planetary stage. In this concept, all gear components float in an unconstrained manner as the planet carrier is substituted with a secondary sun gear. The advantages of the Bearingless Planetary Gearbox over current approaches in terms of improved robustness, load distribution, manufacturability, and assembly are outlined. Finally, analysis, design, and prototyping of rotary planar springs for rotary series elastic actuators is described.

The under-actuated mechanism consists of a high torque micro motor with a small reel for driving a tendon that moves the three joints of the finger. An elastic element maintains the finger bones tied together and extended by default, providing a compliant response against collisions with walls, the floor or any object in the environment during the grasping operation. Compliance provided by the elastic joints will also be exploited for stable object grasping and for collision detection. The development of a specific electronics for finger control instead of employing conventional servos make possible the design and application of a wider range of control strategies, including position, velocity or open-loop force control.

This paper explores a onedimensional haptic force display that combines a DC motor and a magnetic particle brake on the same shaft. Rather than a rigid linkage, a spooled cable connects the user to the actuators to enable a large workspace, reduce the moving mass, and eliminate the sticky residual force from the brake. This design combines the high torque/power ratio of the brake and the active output capabilities of the motor to provide a wider range of forces than can be achieved with either actuator alone.

Shafer; Heidi P. Feigenbaum; Diego Ricardo Higueras Ruiz,"<jats:p>Artificial muscle systems have the potential to impact many technologies ranging from advanced prosthesis to miniature robotics. Recently, it has been shown that twisting drawn polymer monofilaments, such as nylon fishing line or sewing thread, can result in a biomimetic thermally activated torsional actuator. The actuation phenomenon in these twisted polymer actuators (TPAs) is thought to be a result of an untwisting that occurs about the fiber’s axis due to an anisotropic thermal expansion. Before being twisted, the precursor fibers are comprised of polymer chains that are aligned axially. During fabrication of TPAs, the polymer chains reorient as the precursor fiber is twisted about the central axis of the monofilament. At the end of the fabrication process, the TPA is annealed in order to relieve internal stresses and to keep the fiber in the twisted configuration. The mechanism of untwisting actuation is generally thought to be a result of radial expansion and axial contraction. After being twisted, these radial and axial expansion relationships remain relatively unchanged, but the polymer chain direction is no longer axially aligned. Thus, upon heating the twisted fibers of the TPA, the fibers untwist and torsional actuation occurs. This actuation phenomenon has been used in the past to create linear actuators, but can also be use directly as a torsional actuator. Compared to other torsional actuators TPAs are low cost, lightweight, and can actuate reasonably high torques per unit volume. However, because TPAs are thermally activated, they may not be suitable for all applications. In this work, we present a novel TPA design for use as a torsional actuator for miniature actuation and artificial muscle applications. Our design bundles twisted monofilaments to increase the torque. Both fabrication and testing methods of the new design are presented. Results for temperature versus torsional displacement under various loads give insights as to how these actuators may be used and the reversibility of the actuation process under different fabrication loads. Additionally, comparisons are made between these bundled actuators and similarly loaded single TPA monofilament actuation.</jats:p>",,,,,Structural mechanics; Torque; Composite material; Biomimetics; Actuator; Materials science; Torsion (mechanics); Polymer; Anisotropy,,,,,https://nau.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/a-novel-biomimetic-torsional-actuator-design-using-twisted-polyme https://micronanomanufacturing.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings/SMASIS2017/58257/V001T06A006/281896 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings-abstract/SMASIS2017/58257/V001T06A006/281896 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2663095 https://nanoengineeringmedical.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings/SMASIS2017/58257/V001T06A006/281896 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2663095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/smasis2017-3803,,10.1115/smasis2017-3803,2767436444,,0,,4

Michael Mayer; Minoru Asada; Rodrigo da Silva Guerra,"In the Humanoid Leagues balancing during walking and running is still the biggest challenge for most of the teams. We present here some work in which a dynamic walker is stabilised by using a fast heavy rotor, a gyro. The dynamics of a symmetric, fast rotating gyro is different from that of a non-rotating solid body, e.g. in the case of small disturbances it tends to keep the axes the same. Results show that the rotor enhances the stability of the walking in the simulations. In a model for an actuated robot the rotor is used as a reaction wheel, i.e. the pitch of the robot is stabilised by accelerating and decelerating it. We see this method –though it is not biologically inspired – as an intermediate step for learning balancing in biped robots. The control algorithm responsible for balancing the pitch is discussed in detail. The simulations show that, by using this kind of stabilisation, movements like stand up, walk and jump are easily possible by using open loop control for the legs, however high torques for the rotor are necessary.

To realize power-on shifting without torque hole and maximize overall efficiency, a high-speed motor is adopted as the primary motor connecting to the multiple speed clutchless automated manual transmission and a low-speed high torque electric motor is employed as the assisting motor connected to the final shaft with fixed gear ratio.

M. Wu; Barry A. Bender,"A torsional actuator has been developed at NRL utilizing the high piezoelectric shear coefficient, d 15 . This torsional actuator uses an even number of alternately poled segments of electroactive PZT. Under an applied electric field, the torsional actuator produces large angular displacement and a high torque. The solid freeform fabrication technique of the laminated object manufacturing (LOM) is used for rapid prototyping of torsional actuator with potential cost and time saving. First step to demonstrate the feasibility of the LOM technique for the torsional actuator device fabrication is to make near net shape segments. We report a prototype PZT torsional actuator using LOM prepared PZT-5A segments. Fabrication processes and test results are described. The torsional actuator PZT-5A tube has dimensions of 13 cm long, 2.54 cm OD and 1.9 cm ID. Although the piezoelectric strain is small, it may be converted into large displacement via accumulation of the small single cycle displacements over many cycles using AC driving voltage such as with a rotary 'inchworm' actuator or an ultrasonic rotary motor.

Minimization of on-off device null zones, and inherent increase in positioning accuracy, are achieved by incorporating a modulating electric actuator. The actuator design is divided into two major portions: mechanical and electrical. The mechanical portion is essentially a torque amplification device, where the high speed, low torque of a motor is converted to a low speed, high torque at the actuator output. For large amplification and high efficiency with a minimum of components and increased reliability, a positive drive belt and pulley in combination with a ball-bearing screw is used. The result is a series of actuators with output torques from 100 ft-lb to 3200 ft-lb with speed reductions of 500:1 to 1600:1 and mechanical efficiencies of 80 percent The electrical portion of the design incorporates a dc motor with good control characteristics.

Spoială,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> Numerically controlled machines require precise control, because it is always necessary to know the placement of the effector. Control involves the use of electric motors that can be checked with precision. Therefore stepper motors are preferred. A further advance in stepper control is to incorporate a reaction mechanism for the rotor (for example, an encoder) so as communication is optimal for generating the torque, depending on the position of the rotor. This turns the motor into a servo mechanism with very high torque and very good position resolution. An advance in this technique is to operate the motor in a closed loop only if the error of rotor positioning becomes too high. This will allow the system to avoid oscillation while searching for a position, a problem that commonly occurs with servos. The supervision of a numerically controlled tool is limited to the control of electric motors that actuate mechanical assemblies. Control can be implemented by using specialized integrated circuits or microcontrollers. This paper presents a numerically controlled (CNC) machine with microcontroller.</jats:p>",0,0,,,Engineering; Microcontroller; Numerical control; Polystyrene; Computer hardware,,,,,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/sbeef/ahead-of-print/article-10.1515-sbeef-2016-0006/article-10.1515-sbeef-2016-0006.xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/sbeef-2016-0006,,10.1515/sbeef-2016-0006,2604598140,,0,,0

In this paper, a human upper limb-like robot which can mimic the spasticity of stroke patient is proposed as the master device. Therapists can operate this device to perform rehabilitation. In order to mimic the severe spasticity of patients, the device is required to exert high torque. Therefore, high reduction gear was mounted on a stepping motor. As a result, the device becomes non-backdrivable, which decreases its operability. Many researches have ever proposed the admittance control, Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) to solve this problem. Considering about the conditions of our device, admittance control can be realized with a high-accuracy load cell. However, a load cell induces instabilities and high cost. Similar with the SEA, a new structure is proposed in this paper. Two elastic bars are applied to connect the robot's forearm and upper arm. By detecting the bending of these bars, the interaction force exerted on this robot can be calculated. The tiny bending is enlarged with a long bar so that the deformation of elastic bars can be more accurately detected with an optical mouse. To evaluate the efficacy of proposed structure, experiments were conducted to exert three levels resistance using the device. Experimental results show that the proposed structure is effective, and the exerted resistance can be adjusted with it.",,,693,696,Admittance; Engineering; Human–robot interaction; Motion control; Load cell; Actuator; Master/slave; Optical mouse; Simulation; Control theory; Robot,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6548339 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6542767/6548194/06548339.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccme.2013.6548339,,10.1109/iccme.2013.6548339,2001760927,,0,003-821-282-361-434; 010-898-934-533-190; 016-442-390-432-166; 026-764-024-837-299; 043-798-162-884-255; 056-285-174-849-404; 068-214-146-534-824; 081-686-309-932-55X; 097-139-920-509-017; 107-808-233-592-37X; 123-301-488-352-228; 165-953-534-841-258; 168-101-148-835-983,2

Taylor,"The present trend toward the development of gearless robots aims to eliminate mechanical complexity where possible. Consistent with this objective is the increasing use of brushless motors as joint actuators. These electronically commutated motors do have the required characteristic of high torque at low-speed, but pose a challenge for accurate torque control at the joints. It is shown that by coordinating the feedback linearization design of the mechanical link dynamics with that of the electrical motor dynamics, greater control accuracy can be achieved. The feedback linearization is applied to a reduced-order model which accounts for the electrical dynamics with an asymptotic approximation of the integral manifold. A first-order correction to the current commands of joint actuators improves the torque tracking accuracy of the robot. >",,,1670,1675,Direct torque control; Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Actuator; Electric motor; Brushless motors; Electrical dynamics; Control theory; Feedback linearization; Robot,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractKeywords.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=70432&filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A2456%29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cdc.1989.70432,,10.1109/cdc.1989.70432,1924715763,,0,010-063-211-188-535; 048-132-565-625-996; 056-064-626-259-861; 069-614-729-348-627; 072-512-222-311-674; 091-176-944-100-923; 093-547-754-662-194; 099-253-552-064-297; 108-329-951-959-648; 118-990-647-701-663; 121-117-864-715-238; 136-852-377-329-407; 153-869-140-195-25X; 184-107-573-554-549; 192-987-902-466-24X; 196-406-985-177-677,77

By equipping these manipulator arms with an additional 3 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) spherical wrist mechanism, the dexterity and working envelope of the manipulator can be increased. For versatile operations, the motion range for the hydraulic wrist actuators should be close to 360 degrees with high torque output, with a compact volumetric size. Although the wrist can provide a high power-to-weight ratio, the actuators also introduce significant non-linearities in their dynamic behaviors. The complex dynamic behavior combined with high loads yield significant challenges in closed-loop control design. In this paper, we design a novel subsystem-dynamics-based controller for a hydraulically actuated spherical wrist mechanism utilizing the virtual decomposition control (VDC) approach. The proposed 3-DOF wrist controller is designed to be modular; thus, it can be connected as an plug-and-play subsystem into our previously designed state-of-the-art controller for a 3-DOF hydraulic manipulator arm. Stability proof of the overall 6-DOF system is provided. Experiments with a full-scale commercial hydraulic manipulator arm equipped with the 3-DOF spherical wrist demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",,,,,Torque; Actuator; Wrist; Nonlinear model; Control equipment; Computer science; Control theory,,,,,https://ebooks.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801 https://electrochemical.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801 https://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801 https://www.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings-abstract/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801 https://solarenergyengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801 https://vibrationacoustics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A027/1071801,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/fpmc2019-1663,,10.1115/fpmc2019-1663,2996258566,,0,,0
027-603-909-559-926,Envera Variable Compression Ratio Engine,2011-03-15,2011,report,,,Office of Scientific and Technical Information  (OSTI),,Charles Mendler,"Aggressive engine downsizing, variable compression ratio and use of the Atkinson cycle are being combined to improve fuel economy by up to 40 percent relative to port fuel injected gasoline engines, while maintaining full engine power. Approach Engine downsizing is viewed by US and foreign automobile manufacturers as one of the best options for improving fuel economy. While this strategy has already demonstrated a degree of success, downsizing and fuel economy gains are currently limited. With new variable compression ratio technology however, the degree of engine downsizing and fuel economy improvement can be greatly increased. A small variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has the potential to return significantly higher vehicle fuel economy while also providing high power. Affordability and potential for near term commercialization are key attributes of the Envera VCR engine. VCR Technology To meet torque and power requirements, a smaller engine needs to do more work per stroke. This is typically accomplished by boosting the incoming charge with either a turbo or supercharger so that more energy is present in the cylinder per stroke to do the work. With current production engines the degree of engine boosting (which correlates to downsizing) is limited by detonation (combustion knock) at high boost levels. Additionally, the turbo or supercharger needs to be responsive and efficient while providing the needed boost. VCR technology eliminates the limitation of engine knock at high load levels by reducing compression ratio to {approx}9:1 (or whatever level is appropriate) when high boost pressures are needed. By reducing the compression ratio during high load demand periods there is increased volume in the cylinder at top dead center (TDC) which allows more charge (or energy) to be present in the cylinder without increasing the peak pressure. Cylinder pressure is thus kept below the level at which the engine would begin to knock. When loads on the engine are low the compression ratio can be raised (to as much as 18:1) providing high engine efficiency. It is important to recognize that for a well designed VCR engine cylinder pressure does not need to be higher than found in current production turbocharged engines. As such, there is no need for a stronger crankcase, bearings and other load bearing parts within the VCR engine. The Envera VCR mechanism uses an eccentric carrier approach to adjust engine compression ratio. The crankshaft main bearings are mounted in this eccentric carrier or 'crankshaft cradle' and pivoting the eccentric carrier 30 degrees adjusts compression ratio from 9:1 to 18:1. The eccentric carrier is made up of a casting that provides rigid support for the main bearings, and removable upper bearing caps. Oil feed to the main bearings transits through the bearing cap fastener sockets. The eccentric carrier design was chosen for its low cost and rigid support of the main bearings. A control shaft and connecting links are used to pivot the eccentric carrier. The control shaft mechanism features compression ratio lock-up at minimum and maximum compression ratio settings. The control shaft method of pivoting the eccentric carrier was selected due to its lock-up capability. The control shaft can be rotated by a hydraulic actuator or an electric motor. The engine shown in Figures 3 and 4 has a hydraulic actuator that was developed under the current program. In-line 4-cylinder engines are significantly less expensive than V engines because an entire cylinder head can be eliminated. The cost savings from eliminating cylinders and an entire cylinder head will notably offset the added cost of the VCR and supercharging. Replacing V6 and V8 engines with in-line VCR 4-cylinder engines will provide high fuel economy at low cost. Numerous enabling technologies exist which have the potential to increase engine efficiency. The greatest efficiency gains are realized when the right combination of advanced and new technologies are packaged together to provide the greatest gains at the least cost. Aggressive engine downsizing with variable compression ratio and use of the extended Atkinson cycle can provide large fuel economy gains that are exceptionally cost effective. Analysis indicates that a 2.2L supercharged Envera VCR engine can match the torque of a larger V8 engine at 2000 rpm. The VCR engine's high torque value at low engine speed is beneficial for maintaining the driving feel and responsiveness of the larger V8 engine. The Envera VCR engine will attain high efficiency at {approx}100 Nm primarily due to the combination of engine down-sizing and use of the Atkinson cycle. Qualitatively the fuel economy gain realized from down-sizing from a V8 to an Atkinson-cycle I-4 is about twice as large as the benefits from down-sizing from a V8 to a Turbo V6 when evaluated at 100 Nm 2000 rpm.",,,,,Atkinson cycle; Mean effective pressure; Crankcase; Engine efficiency; Automotive engineering; Cylinder head; Materials science; Compression ratio; Engine power; Variable compression ratio,,,,,http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1014534 https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc841051/m2/1/high_res_d/1014534.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/71272354 https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc841051/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/1014534,,10.2172/1014534,1547373675,,0,,1
028-148-946-846-371,Modeling and experimental validation of an ultrasonic rotary motor,,2007,dissertation,,,,,Cuevas Gutiérrez; Carlos Cuauhtémoc,"Ultrasonic motors are a new type of actuators that use mechanical vibrations of its stator to drive the rotor through frictional forces between the interface of the stator and rotor. Ultrasonic motors have recently been attracting considerable attention in industrial applications where high precision, fast response and high torque at low speed are desirable. In contrast to traditional electromagnetic motors, ultrasonic motors provide larger torque to volume ratio, silent operation, and compact design. Furthermore, its operation is not affected by electromagnetic fields, and the motor shaft remains braked when the power supply is removed. The commercial development of ultrasonic motors, however, has been limited primarily due to lack of complete models for the purpose of control. Consequently, the development of an accurate model based on the physical structure is extremely vital for controllers development. The present dissertation proposes a comprehensive model for the purpose of predicting the motor performance. A lumped-mass model of the stator is proposed to consider the coupling effects on the stator based on the flexibility influence coefficients, which are estimated from a finite element method. Moreover, the stator natural frequencies are obtained using modal analysis. Nonlinear tangential interface forces between the rotor and stator are incorporated into the driving torque function. A rotor model based on the Stribeck effect, Coulomb and viscous friction is also incorporated to describe the friction torque associated with the motor response. An extensive series of experiments have been designed together with a state-of-the-art test bench built at the laboratory of Concordia University. The validity of the proposed model was examined by comparing the model results with the measured data under different excitation conditions. The lumped-mass model is able to reproduce reasonably well the stator displacements and the excited modes when it is driven at different frequencies as a result of the stiffness coupling. Several rotor model parameters are identified by using the experimental data and a weighted error minimization function. From the results obtained in the present study, it is concluded that the proposed USM model can reproduce reasonably well the motor behavior to different excitations inputs such as step, ramp and harmonic excitations as well as the torque-speed characteristics. It is important to note that the developed model shows torque-speed hysteresis behavior, which has not been reported in literature. To experimentally confirm this new phenomenon, extensive experimental tests have been conducted to identify the torque-speed characteristics on the ultrasonic motor. It has been observed from experiments a clear torque-speed hysteresis in the ultrasonic motor attributed mainly to the friction drive principle at the contact interface. This behavior, however, has not been addressed previously. It is suggested that the lack of an appropriate instrumentation together with inadequate models have made very difficult to describe this phenomenon. On the other hand, the torque-speed hysteresis exhibits a high asymmetric behavior at low speed as a result of the friction torque produced by the Stribeck effect",,,,,Direct torque control; Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Vector control; Friction torque; Rotor (electric); Squirrel-cage rotor; Stator; Friction drive; Control theory,,,,,https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/975352/,https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/975352/,,,113917741,,0,,0

Elasticity of normal tissue can differ significantly with pathological tissue in its stiffness. It is important to develop a clinical viable method to determine and visualize the elasticity of histological tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) elastography is a promising noninvasive method to quantitatively measure the viscoelastic properties of biological tissue. We developed a new quasi-static actuation system with the spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) imaging pulse sequence. The MR compatible actuation system consists of an ultrasonic motor, a force sensor, motion-transmission mechanism, ECG signal generation, and controller. The high torque ultrasonic motor, USR60-E3 by Shinsei Corporation, Japan, can function well in the magnetic environment. The simulated ECG signal is generated using function generator, and outputted to both MR scanner and controller respectively. SPAMM imaging sequence is utilized to acquire tagging images of the deformed tissue. The actuation is synchronized with the SPAMM sequence via simulated ECG signal. Indentation force is measured by MR compatible force sensor for the subsequent stiffness inversion procedure. Imaging experiments were conducted using this actuation system and a GE SIGNA 1.5T MR scanner. Clear tag-deformed images of agar gel phantom have been acquired. The results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing SPAMM sequence and the proposed actuation system for tissue characterization. In comparison with dynamic method of MR elastography, this quasi-static method is relatively simple to implement since no motion sensitive gradient or gradient synchronization is required. A limitation of indentation method is the difficulty to obtain significant deformation of tumor inside the liver organ. Since radio frequency (RF) needle is inserted into liver organ during tumor ablation, the proposed system with needle-based actuation making use of this inevitable insertion will be able to intra-operatively image the liver tumor during ablation. The RF needle can directly vibrate the pathological tissue within the liver organ.</jats:p>",4,2,027520,,Biomedical engineering; Materials science; Elastography; Control equipment; Force sensor,,,,,http://MedicalDevices.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1474068 https://MedicalDevices.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1474068 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/medicaldevices/article/4/2/027520/433905/A-New-Actuation-System-With-Simulated,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.3443173,,10.1115/1.3443173,2056702182,,0,,1

Unlike other optimization techniques, this method can identify the dominant parameters of the design and investigate their interactions with the design output while reducing the search space and the design time. The second contribution is the design optimization of a novel MR-brake, which incorporates a serpentine flux path and a permanent magnet. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such MR-brake. The new MR-brake design provides a fail-safe feature while reducing the volume by decreasing the number of coil turns required.

Series clutch actuators, used without an elastic element, can achieve excellent position control or can be used as a force/torque source. Clutches based on different physical principles can be employed; while recently a lot of research has been performed on clutches based on magnetorheological fluid (MR fluid), they still have a relatively low torque-to-weight ratio, which makes the integration into robots difficult. In industrial applications magnetic particle clutches are preferred, as they have proven their reliability, but they are even heavier for the same torque. Friction clutches have a higher torque-to-weight ratio, but are generally considered to be difficult to control. The goal of this research is to evaluate series clutch actuators with a high torque-to-weight ratio for open-loop torque control and collision safety. First, the characteristics of electromagnetically controlled clutches based on friction, MR fluid, and magnetic particles are profiled. Subsequently, simple model-based open loop torque control is implemented and the hysteresis, step response, and frequency response are evaluated. The friction clutch has a higher hysteresis and torque variation than the other clutches, but a faster step response and a comparable frequency response. Collision experiments are conducted and the results show that also for collisions the torque can be controlled. Furthermore, in contact free motion, by using clutch settings that fulfill the dynamic torque requirements, unhindered position control is feasible, and by using torque limits that are only slighter higher than the dynamic requirements, safer actuation can be achieved. In conclusion, electromagnetically controlled friction clutches not only have a high torque-to-weight ratio (in our case 8 N $\cdot$ m/0.32 kg), but are also a viable option for torque control.",3,1,297,304,Torque sensor; Direct torque control; Coupling; Engineering; Friction torque; Stall torque; Clutch; Torque converter; Damping torque; Control theory,,,,JSPS; Advanced Research and Technology,https://waseda.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/evaluation-of-series-clutch-actuators-with-a-high-torque-to-weigh https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ral/ral3.html#WangSKLWMSS18 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8004520 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8004520/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/lra.2017.2737482,,10.1109/lra.2017.2737482,2743926282,,0,001-279-920-315-695; 002-418-571-502-153; 004-456-772-612-826; 004-984-233-690-445; 005-992-265-623-761; 008-558-328-476-20X; 016-220-815-752-760; 021-824-391-356-366; 029-242-921-801-692; 034-337-381-194-969; 052-281-918-938-327; 067-880-287-076-837; 085-104-676-120-548; 089-715-404-827-45X; 091-705-806-324-321; 111-935-217-527-451; 123-967-760-609-733; 147-640-551-542-938; 161-363-997-340-059,2

Because of the unique geometry of the stator, these permanent magnets are readily accessible. Therefore, for experimental purposes, simple iron blocks are used to 'short' a large portion of the permanent magnet flux and thus reduce the back EMF developed within the machine. However, for practical applications, field weakening schemes involving miniature linear actuators or high torque stepper motors are being explored.

Scandellari,"SRM main features are good robustness and high specific torque and power; however, its simple structure is intrinsically characterized by a highly non-uniform torque. The above characteristics are very important for medium power, high reliability applications, but in robotics a high torque ripple is not admissible, especially in direct coupled actuators and/or in position controls. In this paper the approach of adopting a control of the phase current shape, while keeping the original simple magnetic structure, is presented. The solution shows the capability to keep torque non-uniformity under a few percent, thus achieving remarkable improvements in machine controllability at low speed, down to standstill. The experimental test of an accurate position control is reported. >",,,1764,1769,Torque sensor; Direct torque control; Switched reluctance motor; Engineering; Torque; Stall torque; Machine control; Torque ripple; Damping torque; Control theory,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=339341&punumber%3D1044%26sortType%3Dasc_p_Sequence%26filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A7958%29%26pageNumber%3D2 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel2/1044/7958/00339341.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iecon.1993.339341,,10.1109/iecon.1993.339341,1815665709,,0,006-835-679-551-03X; 030-805-699-964-627; 038-567-440-940-861; 110-514-589-715-742; 116-207-931-927-344; 189-840-003-258-354,2

To make exoskeleton robots more friendly and accessible to patients, they need to be lightweight and compact without major performance tradeoffs. Existing upper-limb exoskeleton robots focus on the assistance of the coarse-motion of the upper arm while the fine-motion rehabilitation of the forearm is often ignored. This paper presents a wrist robot with three degrees-of-freedom. Using a geared bearing, slider crank mechanisms, and a spherical mechanism, this robot can provide the complete motion assistance for the forearm. The optimized robot dimensions allow large torque and rotation output while the motors are placed parallel to the forearm. Thus lightweight, compactness, and better inertia properties can be achieved. Linear and rotary series elastic actuators (SEAs) with high torque-to-weight ratios are proposed to accurately measure and control the interaction force and impedance between the robot and the wrist.

030-749-067-094-228,Adaptive control of compliant robots with Reservoir Computing,,2013,dissertation,,,,,Tim Waegeman,"In modern society, robots are increasingly used to handle dangerous, repetitive and/or heavy tasks with high precision. Because of the nature of the tasks, either being dangerous, high precision or simply repetitive, robots are usually constructed with high torque motors and sturdy materials, that makes them dangerous for humans to handle. In a car-manufacturing company, for example, a large cage is placed around the robot’s workspace that prevents humans from entering its vicinity. In the last few decades, efforts have been made to improve human-robot interaction. Often the movement of robots is characterized as not being smooth and clearly dividable into sub-movements. This makes their movement rather unpredictable for humans. So, there exists an opportunity to improve the motion generation of robots to enhance human-robot interaction. One interesting research direction is that of imitation learning. Here, human motions are recorded and demonstrated to the robot. Although the robot is able to reproduce such movements, it cannot be generalized to other situations. Therefore, a dynamical system approach is proposed where the recorded motions are embedded into the dynamics of the system. Shaping these nonlinear dynamics, according to recorded motions, allows for dynamical system to generalize beyond demonstration. As a result, the robot can generate motions of other situations not included in the recorded human demonstrations.; In this dissertation, a Reservoir Computing approach is used to create a dynamical system in which such demonstrations are embedded. Reservoir Computing systems are Recurrent Neural Network-based approaches that are efficiently trained by considering only the training of the readout connections and retaining all other connections of such a network unchanged given their initial randomly chosen values. Although they have been used to embed periodic motions before, they were extended to embed discrete motions, or both. This work describes how such a motion pattern-generating system is built, investigates the nature of the underlying dynamics and evaluates their robustness in the face of perturbations. Additionally, a dynamical system approach to obstacle avoidance is proposed that is based on vector fields in the presence of repellers. This technique can be used to extend the motion abilities of the robot without need for changing the trained Motion Pattern Generator (MPG). Therefore, this approach can be applied in real-time on any system that generates a certain movement trajectory.; Assume that the MPG system is implemented on an industrial robotic arm, similar to the ones used in a car factory. Even though the obstacle avoidance strategy presented is able to modify the generated motion of the robot’s gripper in such a way that it avoids obstacles, it does not guarantee that other parts of the robot cannot collide with a human. To prevent this, engineers have started to use advanced control algorithms that measure the amount of torque that is applied on the robot. This allows the robot to be aware of external perturbations. However, it turns out that, even with fast control loops, the adaptation to compensate for a sudden perturbation, is too slow to prevent high interaction forces. To reduce such forces, researchers started to use mechanical elements that are passively compliant (e.g., springs) and light-weight flexible materials to construct robots. Although such compliant robots are much safer and inherently energy efficient to use, their control becomes much harder. Most control approaches use model information about the robot (e.g., weight distribution and shape). However, when constructing a compliant robot it is hard to determine the dynamics of these materials. Therefore, a model-free adaptive control framework is proposed that assumes no prior knowledge about the robot. By interacting with the robot it learns an inverse robot model that is used as controller. The more it interacts, the better the control be- comes. Appropriately, this framework is called Inverse Modeling Adaptive (IMA) control framework. I have evaluated the IMA controller’s tracking ability on sev- eral tasks, investigating its model independence and stability. Furthermore, I have shown its fast learning ability and comparable performance to taskspecific designed controllers.; Given both the MPG and IMA controllers, it is possible to improve the inter- actability of a compliant robot in a human-friendly environment. When the robot is to perform human-like motions for a large set of tasks, we need to demonstrate motion examples of all these tasks. However, biological research concerning the motion generation of animals and humans revealed that a limited set of motion patterns, called motion primitives, are modulated and combined to generate advanced motor/motion skills that humans and animals exhibit. Inspired by these interesting findings, I investigate if a single motion primitive indeed can be modulated to achieve a desired motion behavior. By some elementary experiments, where an MPG is controlled by an IMA controller, a proof of concept is presented. Furthermore, a general hierarchy is introduced that describes how a robot can be controlled in a biology-inspired manner. I also investigated how motion primitives can be combined to produce a desired motion. However, I was unable to get more advanced implementations to work. The results of some simple experiments are presented in the appendix. Another approach I investigated assumes that the primitives themselves are undefined. Instead, only a high-level description is given, which describes that every primitive on average should contribute equally, while still allowing for a single primitive to specialize in a part of the motion generation. Without defining the behavior of a primitive, only a set of untrained IMA controllers is used of which each will represent a single primitive. As a result of the high-level heuristic description, the task space is tiled into sub-regions in an unsupervised manner. Resulting in controllers that indeed represent a part of the motion generation. I have applied this Modular Architecture with Control Primitives (MACOP) on an inverse kinematic learning task and investigated the emerged primitives. Thanks to the tiling of the task space, it becomes possible to control redundant systems, because redundant solutions can be spread over several control primitives. Within each sub region of the task space, a specific control primitive is more accurate than in other regions allowing for the task complexity to be distributed over several less complex tasks.; Finally, I extend the use of an IMA-controller, which is tracking controller, to the control of under-actuated systems. By using a sample-based planning algorithm it becomes possible to explore the system dynamics in which a path to a desired state can be planned. Afterwards, MACOP is used to incorporate feedback and to learn the necessary control commands corresponding to the planned state space trajectory, even if it contains errors. As a result, the under-actuated control of a cart pole system was achieved. Furthermore, I presented the concept of a simulation based control framework that allows the learning of the system dynamics, planning and feedback control iteratively and simultaneously.",,,,,Adaptive control; Engineering; Control engineering; Reservoir computing; Motion control; Robotic arm; Social robot; Control theory; Obstacle avoidance; Control theory; Robot,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4266574 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4266574/file/4336887.pdf,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4266574,,,2300668509,,0,,0

However, this makes their structures larger, heavier, and more complicated. In order to remove these drawbacks, the development of spherical actuators with multi-DOF is necessary. In this paper, we propose a new 3-DOF outer rotor electromagnetic spherical actuator with high torque density and wide rotation angles. The dynamic characteristics are computed employing 3-D FEM and its effectiveness is verified by carrying out measurements on a prototype.

Magnetic nanoparticles are also used in magnetic storage devices, drug delivery systems, and ferrofluids. Improvement of the magnetic properties of Nd 2 Fe 14 B rare-earth magnets would allow for production of small, lightweight, high-torque motors for use in energy-saving household appliances. However, because of the chemical instability of Nd 2 Fe 14 B nanoparticles, it is challenging to synthesize them with high purity by chemical synthesis or by conventional metallurgy methods using Nd 2 Fe 14 B alloys. In addition, the high reduction potential of Nd 3+ makes reduction difficult. In this study, block copolymers were used as templates for chemical synthesis of Nd 2 Fe 14 B nanoparticles. In the synthesis, tris(acetylacetonato) iron(III) as an iron precursor, neodymium tris(acetylacetonate) hydrate as a neodymium precursor, and 1,1-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)ferrocene as a boron precursor were introduced into a polystyrene- b -poly(2-vinylpyridine) block copolymer template. Then, the block copolymer was removed by oxidation. After reduction with CaH 2 and washing with water to remove residual Ca species, highly pure Nd 2 Fe 14 B nanoparticles were obtained. Under the optimized experimental conditions, nanoparticles with a coercivity of 3.5 kOe and a saturation magnetization of 158 emu/g were obtained. The saturation magnetization was 93.5% of the theoretical value of Nd 2 Fe 14 B (169 emu/g).",85,,125,129,Coercivity; Nanoparticle; Ferrofluid; Nanotechnology; Saturation (magnetic); Materials science; Polystyrene; Chemical engineering; Boron; Neodymium; Magnetic nanoparticles,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966979516305052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intermet.2017.02.011,,10.1016/j.intermet.2017.02.011,2591152478,,0,006-363-181-231-829; 010-034-131-856-203; 012-237-428-486-381; 014-201-123-894-42X; 022-456-061-939-614; 022-724-964-400-634; 022-823-643-395-954; 027-754-592-221-094; 028-846-461-779-914; 031-917-984-953-743; 039-205-198-247-660; 042-590-727-487-128; 069-972-537-615-145; 080-104-692-831-348; 082-980-548-203-032; 095-410-700-981-97X; 101-662-620-810-325; 103-089-782-124-735; 107-088-725-100-375; 120-248-992-337-562; 121-597-943-262-551; 148-537-813-746-553; 177-292-383-252-965,6

The design of the Carpal Wrist actuator involves understanding its kinematics based on Dr. Anthony Ganino’s master’s thesis [2]. The fabrication of the design involves 3D printing the Carpal Wrist and the gearbox, which are then assembled and tested. Variable loading was applied on the end effector to determine the rated torque of the actuator.

The simple structure of MDOF-SUSMs makes them useful as compact actuators, but their development is still insufficient for applications such as joints of humanoid robots and other systems that require MDOF and high torque. To increase the torque of a sandwich-type MDOF-SUSM, we have not only made the vibrating stator and spherical rotor larger but also improved the structure using three design concepts: (1) increasing the strength of all three vibration modes using multilayered piezoelectric actuators (MPAs) embedded in the stator, (2) enhancing the rigidity of the friction driving portion of the stator for transmitting more vibration force to the friction-driven rotor surface, and (3) making the support mechanism more stable. An MDOF-SUSM prototype was tested, and the maximum torques of rotation around the X(Y)-axis and Z-axis were measured as 1.48 N∙m and 2.05 N∙m, respectively. Moreover, the values for torque per unit weight of the stator were obtained as 0.87 N∙m/kg for the X(Y)-axis and 1.20 N∙m/kg for the Z-axis. These are larger than values reported for any other sandwich-type MDOF-SUSM of which we are aware. Hence, the new design concepts were shown to be effective for increasing torque. In addition, we measured the transient response and calculated the load characteristics of rotation around the rotor’s three orthogonal axes.",7,1,8,,Ultrasonic motor; Torque; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Materials science; Vibration; Acoustics; Stator; Rigidity (psychology); Transient response,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/159353570 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0825/7/1/8 https://doi.org/10.3390/act7010008,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/act7010008,,10.3390/act7010008,2794178277,,0,003-989-214-010-201; 006-794-939-988-10X; 012-729-805-591-293; 021-117-122-555-962; 024-674-486-597-654; 027-216-809-781-116; 040-337-165-590-008; 044-569-354-423-40X; 044-614-002-070-305; 053-319-724-261-714; 062-086-480-192-581; 072-059-679-224-105; 076-113-311-010-977; 080-374-100-866-337; 089-802-941-581-956; 100-341-490-787-863; 106-205-668-015-775; 136-773-531-079-130; 141-191-371-601-559; 147-537-711-816-745; 152-310-124-684-623; 161-928-995-427-340,3

So it is very useful for a standalone type walking robot. But this hydraulic actuator needs a hydraulic power pack which supplies pressure and flow rate to generate the torque. The weight of the hydraulic power pack is in proportion to the supply pressure and the supply flow. Therefore to generate high torque and large flow, a big and heavy power pack is needed. Especially this hydraulic power pack is a burden to the standalone type walking robot. So a lightweight hydraulic power pack is required for the standalone type walking robot. Also ground reaction force is a major reason to make balancing of the robot unstable in walking robot. In this paper, we propose a redundantly actuated quadruped robot which is actuated by hydraulic actuator. Using the kinematic redundancy of each leg mechanism, flow rate and ground reaction force reduction algorithm is proposed simultaneously.

T. van der Helm; Herman van der Kooij,"Passive, energy-dissipating actuators are promising for force-coordination training in stroke rehabilitation, as they are inherently safe and have a high torque-to-weight ratio. The goal of this study is to determine if hydraulic disk brakes are suitable to actuate an upper-extremity exoskeleton, for application in rehabilitation settings. Passive actuation with friction brakes has direct implications for joint control. Braking is always opposite to the movement direction. During standstill, the measured torque is equal to the torque applied by the human. During rotations, it is equal to the brake torque. Actively assisting movement is not possible, nor are energy-requiring virtual environments. The evaluated disk brake has a 20 Nm bandwidth flat-spectrum, multi-sine of 10 Hz; sufficient for torques required for conventional therapy and simple, passive virtual environments. The maximum static output torque is 120 Nm, sufficient for isometric training of the upper extremity. The minimal impedance is close zero, with only the inertia of the device felt.

The significant gain in the performance of SCs is due to excellent electroactive surface per unit area (surface roughness 97.6 nm) of GPU composite and high electrical conductivity (0.318 S cm−1). The fabricated SCs show stable response for more than 15 000 charging/discharging cycles at current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and operating voltage of 2.5 V (without considering the IR drop). The developed SCs are tested as energy storage devices for wide applications, namely: a) solar‐powered energy‐packs to operate 84 light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) for more than a minute and to drive the actuators of a prosthetic limb; b) powering high‐torque motors; and c) wristband for wearable sensors.",6,7,1802251,,Composite number; Surface roughness; Light-emitting diode; Materials science; Current density; Graphene; Optoelectronics; Supercapacitor; Energy storage; Diode,energy autonomy; flexible supercapacitors; graphite; photovoltaic cells; wearable systems,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/37300/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.201802251 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989034 https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/graphenegraphite-polyurethane-composite-based-high-energy-density http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/175262/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/advs.201802251,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.201802251,30989034,10.1002/advs.201802251,2914214206,PMC6446598,0,001-251-072-610-792; 003-551-642-789-77X; 004-696-212-660-777; 005-630-586-398-798; 006-598-581-327-199; 007-564-116-190-554; 009-244-975-616-584; 009-294-126-067-993; 010-679-816-141-014; 011-606-112-011-237; 011-935-237-608-069; 012-597-095-185-132; 014-920-903-301-438; 016-897-419-139-096; 017-771-176-182-374; 018-330-585-565-926; 019-482-684-946-723; 019-796-370-564-302; 020-273-733-864-535; 023-186-099-796-064; 025-967-160-152-933; 030-044-149-599-828; 030-409-011-568-008; 030-493-473-723-29X; 030-826-021-653-289; 030-970-848-535-500; 031-886-946-026-368; 031-907-669-682-016; 032-641-525-030-722; 032-971-071-254-415; 033-831-596-226-208; 036-783-775-726-086; 039-426-933-704-602; 042-406-513-144-020; 042-711-076-972-442; 045-225-014-109-921; 048-945-754-339-719; 048-989-052-293-634; 049-869-030-502-490; 050-408-161-525-696; 052-046-254-618-581; 056-334-015-537-997; 056-388-144-650-623; 057-120-294-251-07X; 069-739-823-597-880; 072-137-478-211-405; 072-745-827-117-660; 074-264-120-606-968; 075-820-351-932-067; 078-211-127-205-581; 078-939-478-801-053; 080-913-962-182-860; 092-753-677-702-914; 094-161-201-517-004; 099-855-401-550-755; 103-179-676-681-203; 107-251-283-374-201; 114-417-669-073-269; 117-079-498-137-124; 120-118-023-097-226; 142-638-494-708-158,27

Unlike proportional fin actuators, the Electromagnetic-Spring Actuator (EMSA) has discrete outputs (bang-off-bang) but does not need power trains like gears. The simple mechanism of EMSA makes it easy to build small size, low cost, and relatively high torque actuators. But, the discrete bang-off-bang operation degrades the dynamic performance and accuracy of the missile. Therefore, EMSA is required to have fast response characteristics to mitigate the negative effects of bang-off-bang operation on the dynamics performance of missiles. In this paper, the development of EMSA including parameter optimization, degaussing, and mathematical modeling is described. The experimental results of EMSA and simulation using Simulink are present.",,,,,Degaussing; Electromagnet; Magnetic flux; Actuator; Train; Missile; High torque; Computer science; Control theory; Fin,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8785169 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8766816/8785065/08785169.pdf?arnumber=8785169,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iemdc.2019.8785169,,10.1109/iemdc.2019.8785169,2965816344,,0,066-871-436-990-681; 080-841-160-731-127,0

Among several mission goals and scientific experiments, to demonstrate a high-agility attitude control system, the platform is actuated with an extra array of three orthogonal `High-Torque-Wheels' (HTW). For agile reorientation, however, a challenge arises from the fact that time-optimal slew maneuvers are in general not of the Euler-axis rotation type, specially whenever the actuators are constrained independently. Moreover, BIROS' On-Board-Computer (OBC) can only accommodate rotational acceleration commands twice per second. Our objective is therefore to find a methodology to design fast slew maneuvers while considering a highly dynamic plant commanded by piecewise-constant sampled-time control inputs. We do this by considering a comprehensive analytical nonlinear model for spacecraft equipped with reaction wheels and transcribing a time-optimal control problem formulation into a multi-criteria optimization problem which is then solved with a direct approach in a sequential procedure ; using the trajectory optimization package `trajOpt' of ; DLR-SR's optimization tool MOPS `Multi-Objective Parameter Synthesis'. Our approach for efficient design of rest-to-rest fast slew maneuvers considers an attitude error whose magnitude is proportional to Euler-axis rotations between current and desired attitudes even for large initial attitude errors.

We have proposed a walking support robot equipped with velocity and torque-based mechanical safety devices. The velocity-based safety device and the torque-based safety device are attached to each drive-shaft of the robot. If the velocity-based safety device detects an unexpected high angular velocity of the drive-shaft, it stops the robot. If the torque-based safety device detects an unexpected high torque of the drive-shaft, it cuts off the torque transmission and switches off all of the robot's motors. This paper proposes a new walking support robot equipped with not only the velocity-based and torque-based safety devices but also contact force-based safety devices. The contact force-based safety device stops the robot if it detects an unexpected large contact force between the robot and the environment (e.g. humans). These safety devices will work even when the computer breaks down, because they consist of only passive mechanical components without actuators, controllers, or batteries. Firstly, we describe the walking support robot with the safety devices. Secondly, we show the prototype walking support robot which we developed.

Harnett,"Electrically-driven direct current (DC) motors are the core component of conventional robots thanks to the ease of computer control and high torque for their size. However, DC motors are often manually attached and soldered into robotic assemblies, and they are not flexible. For soft robotics, researchers have looked to new, compliant materials that are compatible with 3-D printing or other automated assembly methods. In this work we use a computer-controlled embroidery machine to create flat motor windings in flexible fabrics. We model their electromagnetic fields and present them as linear actuators that move a permanent magnet attached to a cable. The fabrication method puts some constraints on the coil design, which are discussed. However, the planar nature of the embroidered sheets enables the designer to use laminar fabrication methods, such as stacking or layering into parts, during 3-D printing. The soft motor windings produced static holding forces of up to 0.25 N and could lift a 0.3 g mass several cm using direct drive. A 3-D printed mechanical amplifier with two stages was able to quadruple the lifting mass, reducing the travel by a factor of 4.

Ravi Chandrudu; T. Naga Jyothi; G. V. P Anjaneyulu,"This paper presents the modelling, simulation, and speed control aspects of a 3-phase 6/4 linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) drives. The Linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) has never been a popular choice for direct-drive linear motion control system; because it is difficult to control and its output has high torque ripples. It is also due to the fact that the actuator's characteristic is highly dependent on its complex magnetic circuit, which is difficult to model, simulate, and control.Fourier series expression of phase self- inductance under the assumption of negligible mutual effect and various losses is introduced to describe the nonlinear dynamic model of SRM.Simulation results have shown the rationality of model and validity of control strategy. By virtue of MATLAB/SIMULINK, the models of various subsystems are achieved and the modelling procedure is described in detail. Linear segmented switched reluctance motor (LSSRM) using full pitched winding can give 40 - 80% higher torque than conventional SRM for the same frame size. This increase in torque is due to the increase in aligned inductance. However, full pitch winding results in high copper loss, and high active weight. Hence, in this paper, single tooth or concentric winding to replace the full pitch winding of LSSRM is proposed. In order to obtain the same flux paths as with full pitch winding, all the three phases must be excited simultaneously. The torque is produced due to changes in mutual inductance. This method of winding results in reduction of copper, and therefore, weight. With such an arrangement, one phase only requires DC supply.",7,1,95,100,Switched reluctance motor; Torque; Actuator; Magnetic circuit; Inductance; Computer science; Electronic speed control; Control theory; Reluctance motor; Linear motion,,,,,http://iosrjournals.org/iosr-jeee/Papers/Vol7-issue1/P07195100.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.9790/1676-07195100,,10.9790/1676-07195100,1968678193,,0,001-904-774-764-070; 028-899-240-418-073; 163-475-321-892-40X,0

To realize a small-sized high-torque actuator, a reduction gear is usually used. Because of the current saturation and friction effect of the actuator, the actuator has maximum values of acceleration and rotation speed. A gear with a high gear ratio reduces these two maximum values because of the presence of a reduction mechanism. The trade-off between the output torque and rotation speed exists. Consequently, it is difficult to achieve high-speed motions using a gear. Moreover, the reduction mechanism increases the friction of the motor and deteriorates its backdrivability. Therefore, in this study, a new actuation mechanism is utilized to solve such problems. The new mechanism consists of an electromagnetic clutch and elastic spring. High backdrivability and high-speed motion are achieved by releasing the clutch and transforming the elastic potential energy accumulated by the geared motor into kinetic energy, respectively. In the proposed system, the output rotation speed exceeds the maximum rotation speed obtained after it is reduced by the gear. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified experimentally.",11,2,117,124,Acceleration; Engineering; Kinetic energy; Elastic energy; Torque; Actuator; Clutch; Control theory; Mechanical engineering; Rotational speed; Electromagnetic clutch,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11740-017-0720-0 https://keio.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/high-speed-and-high-backdrivable-actuation-system-considering-var https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/peng/peng11.html#MiuraK17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11740-017-0720-0,,10.1007/s11740-017-0720-0,2602331871,,0,001-349-141-647-448; 002-418-571-502-153; 005-588-936-254-035; 009-735-245-124-488; 041-834-251-374-313; 043-798-162-884-255; 048-206-644-877-170; 054-523-154-954-90X; 055-663-723-455-088; 062-746-486-327-433; 063-551-301-166-327; 077-679-102-627-136; 084-513-953-682-452; 086-432-503-594-066; 089-715-404-827-45X; 095-845-068-635-16X; 106-636-611-386-553; 135-963-624-203-98X; 164-185-296-593-774,1

Domingues Olavarria,"This document demonstrates a conceptual study, design and development of unconventional electromagnetic actuators for applications where a high torque over a limited part of a rotational turn is required. The unconventionality of the actuators is that the electromagnetic actuation is applied directly on a high ratio transmission gear such as a cycloid disc in a cycloid drive or a flex-spline in a harmonic drive. Furthermore, normal forces are intentionally used to displace and rotate a cycloid disc or deform a flex-spline instead of tangential forces, which are typically used when integrating conventional rotating machine driving a high ratio gear transmission. The conceptual study is based on a number of finite element models where the idea is first presented and followed by field and force analysis. A finite element static model is used to calculate the expected excitation versus the gear location. The gear location of the cycloid disc is defined by an eccentric origin and rotation angle while the flex-spline is defined by a deformation and rotation angle. The analysis of the integrated normal force actuator inside the harmonic drive demonstrates the challenging strain gearing action in terms of elasticity and magnetic saturation. The challenge with the cycloid drive is the electromagnetic action force direction compared to the desired mechanic reaction force direction that causes unnecessary inner load or even locks the gear mechanisms. A prototype machine with the maximized rotor eccentricity is used to characterize four different rolling and geared cycloid transmissions.",,,743,749,Engineering; Finite element method; Torque; Cycloid; Normal force; Actuator; Harmonic drive; Structural engineering; Mechanical engineering; Rotation; Reaction,,,,,http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/cc7ceedd-d3c7-4e49-a584-984d6aab6535 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/search/publication/cc7ceedd-d3c7-4e49-a584-984d6aab6535 https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/direct-electromagnetic-actuation-on-high-ratio-gears(cc7ceedd-d3c7-4e49-a584-984d6aab6535).html https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7732609/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icelmach.2016.7732609,,10.1109/icelmach.2016.7732609,2548508202,,0,014-591-488-430-771; 023-795-229-830-675; 037-185-483-971-377; 037-273-861-145-591; 038-842-824-363-331; 073-931-159-582-043; 075-282-935-518-34X; 099-239-582-059-375; 110-573-567-224-563; 111-052-682-325-813; 112-814-271-231-614; 166-410-597-721-486,0

The PPM actuator is designed to tackle low-speed high-torque applications where classic electromagnetic actuators are highly inefficient. The PPM actuator is based on the application of pulsed current to magnetize a hard ferromagnetic stator that is made of individual SmCo (custom grade) magnets placed in a Halbach array configuration. The motor creates a springlike torque function that generates up to 0.2 N ⋅m. Unlike electromagnetic actuators, by design, the PPM actuator does not draw current while exerting torque. Instead, the motor's power consumption depends on its rotational speed or torque variations. The PPM actuator is, by consequence, most efficient, whereas classical electromagnetic motors are most inefficient, and is a new alternative to actuators for robotic applications, which tend to operate in low-speed, high-torque conditions. The prototyped PPM actuator measures 47 mm in diameter, with a height of 35 mm and weight of 200 g, and has been successfully integrated in a commercially available 2-finger gripper from Robotiq, Inc.",3,3,1751,1758,Electrical engineering; Physics; Torque; Magnet; Actuator; Stator; Low speed; Halbach array; Rotational speed; Ferromagnetism,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Robotiq, Inc.",https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ral/ral3.html#ChossatMLD18 https://espace2.etsmtl.ca/id/eprint/16488/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/lra.2018.2803815,,10.1109/lra.2018.2803815,2789888630,,0,008-391-221-481-154; 013-901-222-977-977; 028-644-720-637-561; 048-284-560-676-594; 059-579-998-080-100; 078-477-345-197-119; 084-464-151-729-644; 088-531-611-745-112; 123-016-907-456-847; 147-607-216-816-909; 155-587-272-604-323; 163-111-790-228-205,1

Lindemann,"The increasing consumption of electrical power in automobiles can be supplied more economically by a new 42V- than by the conventional 12V-system. This paper describes a key component of the 42V system currently being under development: The starter generator, being controlled by power electronics. 42V System with Starter Generator The 42V system shall be used to supply loads with high power consumption such as electrical power steering, electrical valve actuators for the combustion engine or a heater for the catalysator. The higher system voltage compared to conventional 12V helps to reduce the current levels and thus to save copper for cabeling and silicon for switching. It will lead to several changes in the architecture of the electrical network in the cars [1]. A major innovation is the combination of former DC starter and former AC generator in a single AC machine, being connected to the 42V battery via a power electronic converter. It will operate as motor to start the combustion engine with high torque and relatively low speed, and as generator to supply the 42V battery and the loads connected to it over the whole speed range of the running combustion engine. Several arrangements of starter generators are possible: • A belt driven starter generator replaces the conventional generator by an asynchronous motor complemented by a power section, while the conventional starter is omitted. This version may initially be of interest, because it does not require major changes in the arrangement under the hood. However its use is limited by the capabilities of the belt transmission, which does not permit to start big combustion engines with high torque and limits the electrical power to be generated.",,,,,Electrical engineering; Engineering; Electric generator; Motor soft starter; Automotive engineering; Power electronics; Electrical network; Electric power; Starter solenoid; Cold-cranking simulator; Induction generator,,,,,http://www.j-rep.com/download/ixys-appli-book/S157_159.pdf,http://www.j-rep.com/download/ixys-appli-book/S157_159.pdf,,,2183969041,,0,,3

This flexure-based suspension provides the required high radial stiffness (>1000N/mm) combined with a high radial load capacity (500N) over the full range of motion. Furthermore, the suspension maintains a constant position of the pivot axis within 0.1mm, which is required to limit pull-in forces and to stay within alignment tolerances of the actuator.

This electronically controllable viscosity leads to variable friction torque generated by the actuator. A properly designed MR-brake can have a high torque-to-volume ratio which is quite desirable for an actuator. However, designing an MR-brake is a complex process as there are many parameters involved in the design which can affect the size and torque output significantly. The contribution of this study is a new design approach that combines the Taguchi design of experiments method with parameterized finite element analysis for optimization. Unlike the typical multivariate optimization methods, this approach can identify the dominant parameters of the design and allows the designer to only explore their interactions during the optimization process. This unique feature reduces the size of the search space and the time it takes to find an optimal solution. It normally takes about a week to design an MR-brake manually. Our interactive method allows the designer to finish the design in about two minutes. In this paper, we first present the details of the MR-brake design problem. This is followed by the details of our new approach. Next, we show how to design an MR-brake using this method. Prototype of a new brake was fabricated. Results of experiments with the prototype brake are very encouraging and are in close agreement with the theoretical performance predictions.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,1257,1263,Magnetorheological fluid; Viscosity; Engineering; Control engineering; Finite element method; Torque; Friction torque; Parameterized complexity; Actuator; Brake; Control theory,,,,,http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1644634 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1644634 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings/IMECE2011/54938/1257/358575,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/imece2011-65014,,10.1115/imece2011-65014,2029272213,,0,,2

Bourbon; Patrice Minotti; Philippe Langlet; Takahisa Masuzawa; Hiroyuki Fujita,"This paper investigates 3D active microcatheters having millimeter size outer diameters. The proposed architectures combine mechanical cells which involve new direct-drive tubular electrostatic micromotors and conventional shape memory alloy actuators. The tubular electrostatic motors are actuated by silicon surface micromachined flexible stators. The polysilicon stators integrate up to several thousands of direct-drive electrostatic microactuators. However, they have been designed in order to provide a gap compensation at the rotor/motor frame interface. Multiple stator/rotor contact interactions involve a significant speed reduction that allow a large torque amplification, as a consequence of the torque/speed duality. These mechanical interactions allow the rotor to be moved with respect to the motor frame through direct-drive contact mechanisms, therefore allowing high torque/low speed characteristics to be performed. In such a way to get a 3D behavior, the microcatheter combines tubular electrostatic motors having flexible rotors. The rotors integrate Ti-Ni shape memory alloy wires which actuate a 2D bending motion on each mechanical cell. The 3D global behavior of the catheter is provided by the relative rotation of each cell, with respect to the other ones. The proposed architecture is particularly convenient with respect to the electric power supply which is, usually, the major problem in designing active microcatheters. A (Phi) 1 mm 3D active catheter is given as an example, but external diameters less than one millimeter can be easily expected, opening therefore numerous applications in the near future.© (1998) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Heiberg; David A. Bailey; Bong Wie,"Agile spacecraft control requires high torque on demand, with low power and emitted disturbance, to maintain the attitude control, manage the spacecraft momentum, and provide structural disturbance rejection. These demands almost exclusively call for control moment gyroscopes to produce the actuation torque. Single gimbal control moment gyroscopes have been shown to have significant advantages over double gimbal control moment gyroscopes in this role. The advantage of torque amplification translates to power, cost, weight, and performance improvements over double gimbal control moment gyroscopes. However, the use of either type in agile spacecraft gives rise to problems in their implementation; 1) disturbances manifested in the gyroscope gimbal actuators are multiplied and transmitted to the spacecraft, and 2) the presence of singularities prevents utilization of the gyroscope array to its maximum potential. Linear and nonlinear external disturbances have been shown to be easily eliminated utilizing disturbance rejection filters. In addition, non-linear disturbances caused by the control moment gyroscopes that are feed-forward in nature have been shown to be mitigated using the same approach; however, nonlinear disturbances in the feedback loop are more pervasive in nature and are often more difficult to reject. This paper explores rejection of nonlinear disturbances and includes a discussion of control moment gyroscopes array configuration based on singularity and momentum considerations.",,,,,Gimbal; Engineering; Control engineering; Control moment gyroscope; Torque; Attitude control; Gyroscope; Nonlinear system; Feedback loop; Spacecraft; Control theory,,,,,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1997-3757,http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.1997-3757,,10.2514/6.1997-3757,2169195564,,0,000-128-082-030-089; 001-954-733-046-887; 009-049-552-143-988; 022-367-574-721-165; 024-331-486-932-809; 040-214-081-718-107; 045-325-592-792-29X; 045-986-138-265-068; 050-128-741-893-421; 069-641-779-231-834; 085-631-565-887-724; 098-378-841-625-655; 114-451-487-880-122; 118-123-790-969-245; 166-496-805-557-538; 167-224-015-230-941,3

The robot is also capable of 3D motion with an ability to climb in the z-direction. The snake is made of a series links, each containing one to three high torque DC motors and a gearing system. They are connected to each other through Aluminum hollow rods that can be rotated through a 180° span. This allows the snake to move in various environments including unfriendly and cluttered ones. The front link has a proximity sensor used to map the environment. This mapping is sent to a microcontroller which controls and adapts the motion pattern of the snake. The snake can therefore choose to avoid obstacles, or climb over them if their height is within its range. The presented model is made of five links, but this number can be increased as their role is repetitive. The novel design is meant to overcome previous limitations by allowing 3D motion through electric actuators and low energy consumption.",42,,03006,,Engineering; Proximity sensor; Actuator; Microcontroller; Climb; Multi link; High torque; Simulation; DC motor; Robot,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/92116456,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/20164203006,,10.1051/matecconf/20164203006,2283599510,,0,012-525-106-951-398; 013-423-980-338-345; 027-493-104-731-51X; 028-804-276-228-170; 058-475-322-869-352; 079-742-835-977-055; 138-587-707-105-86X,0

Traveling wave motors produce a very high torque at low rotational speed.

Shahed,"Turbo diesel engine use in passenger cars in Europe has resulted in 30-50% improvement in fuel economy. Diesel engine application is particularly suitable for US because of vehicle size and duty cycle patterns. Adopting this technology for use in the US presents two issues--emissions and driveability. Emissions reduction technology is being well addressed with advanced turbocharging, fuel injection and catalytic aftertreatment systems. One way to address driveability is to eliminate turbo lag and increase low speed torque. Electrically assisted turbocharging concepts incorporated in e-TurboTM designs do both. The purpose of this project is to design and develop an electrically assisted turbocharger, e-TurboTM, for diesel engine use in the US. In this report, early design and development of electrical assist technology is described together with issues and potential benefits. In this early phase a mathematical model was developed and verified. The model was used in a sensitivity study. The results of the sensitivity study together with the design and test of first generation hardware was fed into second generation designs. In order to fully realize the benefits of electrical assist technology it was necessary to expand the scope of work to include technology on the compressor side as well as electronicmore » controls concepts. The results of the expanded scope of work are also reported here. In the first instance, designs and hardware were developed for a small engine to quantify and demonstrate benefits. The turbo size was such that it could be applied in a bi-turbo configuration to an SUV sized V engine. Mathematical simulation was used to quantify the possible benefits in an SUV application. It is shown that low speed torque can be increased to get the high performance expected in US, automatic transmission vehicles. It is also shown that e-TurboTM can be used to generate modest amounts of electrical power and supplement the alternator under most load-speed conditions. It is shown that a single (large) e-TurboTM consumes slightly less electrical power for the same steady state torque shaping than a bi-Turbo configuration. However, the transient response of a bi-Turbo configuration in slightly better. It was shown that in order to make full use of additional capabilities of e-TurboTM wide compressor flow range is required. Variable geometry compressor (VGC) technology developed under a separate project was evaluated for incorporation into e-TurboTM designs. It was shown that the combination of these two technologies enables very high torque at low engine speeds. Designs and hardware combining VGC and e-TurboTM are to be developed in a future project. There is concern about high power demands (even though momentary) of e-TurboTM. Reducing the inertia of the turbocharger can reduce power demand and increase battery life. Low inertia turbocharger technology called IBT developed under a separate project was evaluated for synergy with e-TurboTM designs. It was concluded that inertial reduction provided by IBT is very beneficial for e-TurboTM. Designs and hardware combining IBT and e-TurboTM are to be developed in a future project. e-TurboTM provides several additional flexibilities including exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for emissions reduction with minimum fuel economy penalty and exhaust temperature control for aftertreatment. In integrated multi-parameter control system is needed to realize the full potential of e-TurboTM performance. Honeywell expertise in process control systems involving hundreds of sensors and actuators was applied to demonstrate the potential benefits of multi-parameter, model based control systems.« less",,,,,Exhaust gas recirculation; Engineering; Control engineering; Automotive engineering; Turbocharger; Alternator; Turbo-diesel; Diesel engine; Fuel efficiency; Truck; Fuel injection,,,,,https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc784712/m2/1/high_res_d/841240.pdf https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc784712/ https://core.ac.uk/display/71233286 https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/841240,http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/841240,,10.2172/841240,1570743829,,0,,1

Taghirad; A. Helmy; P.R. Belanger,"The unique performance features of harmonic drives, such as high gear ratios and high torque capacities in a compact geometry, justify their widespread industrial application especially in many electrically actuated robot manipulators. In many robotic control strategies it is assumed that the actuator is acting as a torque source, and in order to implement such algorithms it is necessary to accurately measure the transmitted torque by the harmonic drive. In this paper a built-in torque sensor for harmonic drive systems is developed and examined in detail, in which strain-gauges are directly mounted on the harmonic drive flexspline. To minimize sensing inaccuracy, four Rosette strain gauges are used employing an accurate positioning method. To cancel the torque ripples, the oscillation observed on the measured torque and caused mainly by gear teeth meshing, Kalman filter estimation is used. A simple fourth order harmonic oscillator proved to accurately model the torque ripples. Moreover, the error model is extended to incorporate any misalignment torque. By on line implementation of the Kalman filter, it has been shown that this method is a fast and accurate way to filter torque ripples and misalignment torque. Hence, the intelligent built-in torque sensor is a viable and economical way to measure the harmonic drive transmitted torque and to employ that for torque feedback strategies.",48,6,1201,1207,Torque sensor; Direct torque control; Coupling; Engineering; Torque; Stall torque; Electronic engineering; Harmonic drive; Torque converter; Damping torque; Control theory,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/19/17700/00816137.pdf https://doi.org/10.1109/19.816137 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tim/tim48.html#TaghiradB99 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/816137/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/19.816137,,10.1109/19.816137,2150783677,,2,014-296-631-677-960; 015-385-554-944-922; 020-001-753-817-833; 023-380-309-936-766; 027-870-925-679-991; 041-766-193-573-944; 044-561-443-231-470; 063-819-327-762-375; 086-879-268-940-280; 091-545-635-821-306; 109-050-483-592-088; 113-542-178-523-196; 118-214-654-014-018; 132-293-129-601-826; 174-364-884-036-727; 175-442-725-694-922,32

The functional concept is based on bidirectional antagonistic variable stiffness (BAVS) principle, in which elastic actuators are connected in parallel to output link, and an internal torque is generated by the antagonistic motion of two motors to adjust the stiffness. Different from conventional variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) that introduce extra motor to adjust stiffness, BAVS concept treats both motors as main actuators, thereby improving the joint's torque density. The mechanical realization of BAVS principle employs a differential mechanism and makes use of two harmonic reducers in a differential manner. The flexibility of the joint is provided by a non-linear elastic element consisting of linear spring and cam roller mechanism. Low torque density and non-modular design are the main reasons limiting VSAs' application in multi-degree-of-freedom robotic systems. In response to this, the proposed joint is designed to be compact and modular. This article describes the basic principles, the mechanical design and the dynamic modeling of the proposed joint.

Nambu,"Introduction Modular acetabular liners offer surgeons the flexibility of using various bearing materials and sizes to accommodate the patient's needs. The need for a robust locking mechanism to ensure the long term successful performance of the implant is critical due to the hardship a revision surgery would have on the patient. The traditional method to evaluate torque resistance by using epoxy to affix a roughed femoral head to the acetabular liner has been acceptable to this point. However, efforts to design an acetabular liner that is resistant to high torque failures have shown this method to be inadequate to evaluate the performance of the lock detail, as failures only occur between the femoral head and the liner. Therefore a test method that would ensure failure of the lock detail was needed.; ; Materials and Methods In the current study the performance of prototype vs. production acetabular liners and shells were evaluated. Aluminum test shells were provided and a combination of production acetabular liners and prototype liners were provided by the Prototype Department at MicroPort Orthopedics. The traditional method was followed. A custom holding fixture was attached to the load cell plate of the test machine, and a roughed femoral head was attached to the actuator. The appropriate shell and liner combination was selected and assembled using three firm hammer blows with a two pound surgical hammer. Once assembled, the test construct was affixed to the holding fixture mounted to the test machine. Devcon 5 minute epoxy was mixed per the instruction and approximately 10 cc was placed into the cup of the liner. The femoral head was then brought into place using load control until contact was made. After the epoxy had cured torque was applied via the femoral head at a rate of 0.417° per second until failure of the epoxy or the lock detail was observed. In every trial the epoxy failed before the lock detail. A new method was devised. A paddle fixture was fabricated and attached to the actuator of the test frame (See Figure 1). The interior of the cups were modified to receive the paddle fixture. The test was repeated using the new fixation method and failure of the lock detail was achieved.; ; Results and Discussion Table 1 and Figure 2 below shows the results of the torque testing for the group using the epoxy and the group using the mechanical lock fixturing. The development of higher torque resistant polyethylene liners shows a need to develop a fixation method that will ensure the proper evaluation of the lock detail.; ; For figures/tables, please contact authors directly.",,,119,119,Bearing (mechanical); Test method; Hammer; Surgery; Torque; Load cell; Paddle; Femoral head; Fixture; Structural engineering; Medicine,,,,,,,,,2594317850,,0,,0

When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer.

Lovatt,"The design of a high torque brushless DC motor to replace the induction motor and worm gear for valve actuators is described. Minimum motor cost, short axial length and low electronics rating are achieved by selection of open slots and coils wound on bobbins. First and second harmonic designs are compared, with either 2 or 4 magnet poles facing 3 teeth. As well as being cheaper from having fewer coils, the second harmonic design is found to be superior in having lower copper loss at peak torque. The peak tangential force density across the gap was 5.8 /spl times/ 10/sup 4/ N/m/sup 2/.

However, since they are driven by friction between their stator and rotor, they have a problem with wear and, as a result, with the length of useful life. This paper proposes a new piezoelectric cycloid motor, in which the cycloid gear mechanism is used to convert the expansion and contraction of the piezoelectric actuators into the rotational motion of the rotor. Since the motor has no slip motion between its stator and rotor, it is not affected by friction. The fundamental characteristics are theoretically derived, and are examined using a prototype of the motor. The following results are obtained: it rotates steadily and keeps its rotational speed even when the load is increased up to the maximum output torque, 0.014 Nm; the maximum efficiency is 25.5 per cent, which is obtained at 16 rpm within the measuring range of the driving frequency of the motor.",2,5,433,444,Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Piezoelectric motor; Rotor (electric); Squirrel-cage rotor; Torque motor; Wound rotor motor; Control theory; Synchronous motor; Induction motor,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095741589290009D https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/095741589290009D#!,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0957-4158(92)90009-d,,10.1016/0957-4158(92)90009-d,2008213278,,1,022-144-671-938-085; 071-989-361-332-725; 154-924-627-107-034,15

The motor can be easily designed and fabricated as a small actuator due to its simple structure composed of a nib-shaped elastic body frame and two ceramics. Also, the motor is expected to be used as small actuator for auto-focusing camera by designing the size of the motor less than 10[mm], because the ultrasonic motor has general merit of generating high torque in spite of low speed. When two sinusoidal sources with phase difference of 90 degrees are applied to two ceramics, the elliptical displacement is generated at contact tip of the motor. To define vibration shapes and output characteristics of the motor, design parameters were chosen and the modeling of the motor was conducted by using ANSYS 11.0, FEM(Finite Element Method) Program.

For this application a high torque density is beneficial for the volume of these devices. Due to the typical structure of slotted spherical actuators, designs have to be modeled in 3-D to gain accurate results. As commercially available modeling tools, such as FEA (finite element analysis), are very time consuming, semi-analytical models are needed to optimize a design. A slotted topology can be evaluated by including a Neumann boundary, representing material with a high permeability and a surface current density sheet distribution to model the coils [2].

D. Vaughan,"This paper presents a feasibility study into the application of a 100-V, 50-kHz high-frequency ac (HFAC) network for powering automotive electrical auxiliaries. The study is focused on motor-actuated loads and is divided into two sections. First, the investigation indicates the benefits of replacing low-torque dc motors with lighter and more efficient 400-Hz ac machines for applications such as electric fans, fuel pumps, or blower motors. A comparative examination of commercially available machines indicates space and weight reduction of more than 60%, and efficiency savings between 25% and 100% are possible. Second, the inquiry evaluates the viability of replacing existing dc/ac inverters with HFAC/ac converters for high-torque ac machines as employed, for example, in electric-power-assisted steering (EPAS) or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Based on experimental and simulation results for a column-assist EPAS application employing a three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous motor, this paper shows that an HFAC drive is expected to reduce the voltage harmonic content below 50 kHz by at least 10% compared with the dc/ac inverter. However, the disadvantages of the former drive make it less attractive than the existing dc/ac circuit. Specifically, the EPAS motor torque ripple is expected to be approximately 2% higher compared with the dc counterpart drive. Further drawbacks of the HFAC/ac drive include high metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) conduction losses, higher voltage harmonics above 50 kHz, and complex control requirements of the inverter. Conclusively, significant HFAC advantages for motor loads can only be attributed to machines with a nominal torque capability that is limited to 2 N ·m. However, given the number of such devices within a typical vehicle, this translates into a possible vehicle mass saving of 30 kg and a potential reduction in fuel consumption by 0.8 L/100 km.",60,2,390,405,Thyristor drive; Electrical engineering; Engineering; AC/AC converter; AC motor; Power electronics; Torque motor; Electric machine; Synchronous motor; DC motor,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005638164 https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/1826/7632/1/Feasibility_of_High_Frequency_AC_Power-2011.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tvt/tvt60.html#AntaloaeMV11 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/53589/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5638164/ https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/7632 https://trid.trb.org/view/1330064 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9637617.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tvt.2010.2092446,,10.1109/tvt.2010.2092446,2111766817,,1,018-199-873-825-162; 023-926-888-513-347; 024-748-746-357-446; 033-058-925-106-835; 033-401-569-605-181; 035-576-263-056-164; 039-726-477-586-589; 041-315-736-210-427; 041-316-187-432-792; 046-628-945-026-641; 048-137-952-519-870; 049-939-389-042-68X; 053-417-122-113-326; 055-225-547-708-065; 056-996-159-064-984; 057-608-551-117-322; 061-931-541-577-952; 064-236-454-883-235; 071-047-781-850-802; 072-195-377-578-705; 077-019-722-769-545; 083-834-670-209-949; 085-517-286-866-710; 091-097-631-924-096; 107-133-300-895-635; 110-006-629-600-712; 110-953-347-801-220; 115-102-487-396-77X; 124-007-030-352-081; 124-507-324-244-351; 124-602-388-928-918; 126-455-818-986-479; 127-092-116-856-334; 128-748-470-150-321; 129-310-124-999-875; 132-497-853-248-108; 137-773-711-244-531; 138-533-133-866-120; 149-644-164-800-125; 158-741-900-611-017; 171-194-715-966-327; 173-981-632-294-84X,13

Design concepts to synthesize the bounded control algorithms for micromotors in order to attain the desired performance level (accuracy, robustness, settling time, etc.) are introduced. These brushless micromotors are uniquely suited to be used as servo-actuators in robots due to high torque density, high performance, reliability, cost, etc. Open-loop servos with stepper motors cannot satisfy the requirements imposed on high-performance micromanipulators due to the steps missing feature in the presence of disturbances which results to low accuracy and inability to attenuate disturbances. Therefore, the design of closed-loop systems is an important problem to guarantee the spectrum of the specifications imposed on tracking accuracy, disturbance attenuation, stability in the full operating envelope, robustness to parameter variations, steady-state and dynamic performance, etc. To implement the control algorithms, the angular velocity and rotor displacement must be measured or estimated. The key feature is that robots and actuators are nonlinear dynamic systems. In order to derive the lumped parameter model of manipulators with actuators, the Lagrange equations of motion are used. Using a nonlinear manipulator dynamics, control algorithms are synthesized. This paper outlines a new control a procedure. Using the Lyapunov second method, it is shown that bounded robust controllers can be synthesized using the criteria imposed on the Lyapunov pair. Nonquadratic Lyapunov functions are applied, and nonlinear controllers with nonlinear error and feedback maps are designed. The design technique proposed is feasible and straightforward. An illustrative example is examined in detail to demonstrate the efficiency of the control procedure and effectiveness of the control algorithm designed.",4,,3658,3663,Engineering; Control engineering; Nonlinear system; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Stepper; Robust control; Servomechanism; Lyapunov function; Control theory; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1184931/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cdc.2002.1184931,,10.1109/cdc.2002.1184931,1581189155,,0,000-343-921-578-574; 007-752-992-775-825; 012-525-106-951-398; 025-306-742-827-170; 036-919-843-429-332; 045-789-536-187-912; 142-393-421-405-057; 148-449-337-774-763,2

Knowles; Ross Bird; Edward V. White; Michael Valentino,"Several corporations including QorTek and Boeing have both independently proposed variable sweep primary structures for future adaptive airframe structures as to enable miniaturized area dominance munitions and UAVs. Various new vehicle concepts must insert a high power actuator to overcome low speed aerodynamic forces within a limited packaging availability. In order to meet requirements for this and other UAV/UCAV/MMT missions, require a re-thinking on how to accomplish large motor torque/lb (rather than energy/lb) while integrating the speed and torque capability in a small package. The difficulty is highlighted by considering that piezo devices are nicely compact but can only deliver is typically 1-2ft-lb/lb; whereas SMA has potential of being lighter solution and can deliver 100-200 ft-lb/lb but has two problems: slow recovery and large weight penalty for thermal components. Fortunately, some munition applications have relatively modest control surface actuation bandwidth requirements. However, until now, the thermal aspect has been prohibitive. QorTek will present a new SMA-based motor that provides high torque/lb for UAV/UCAV/MMT systems. This unique motor design has eliminated the need for additional power components for thermal excitation (transient heating) of the SMA elements as to accomplish phase transition.

Kawak,"Abstract The agility of the spacecraft which refers to the spacecraft's ability to execute fast and accurate manoeuvers within a fixed period of time, is a key satellite parameter. The spacecraft' s agility is directly proportional to the spacecraft actuators' output torque. For high torque inertial actuators (>0.5 Nm), Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) exhibits better performances in terms of mass and electrical power consumption than reaction wheels. However, in addition to the complex steering law required to avoid CMG singularities, one of the reasons why CMGs are not widely used is also due to their high micro-vibration emission which may interfere and disrupt the spacecraft' s sensitive instruments such as optical payloads. In this paper, an innovative two-stage viscoelastic isolation system has been designed and implemented in a new low micro-vibration CMG prototype. The first stage of the damping system acts at bearing level to attenuate the possible shock vibrations while the second stage acts at mechanism level to attenuate the structural resonances and motor noise. The developed CMG enables to combine high actuator output torque with a low micro-vibration signature. The viscoelastic damping system is cost effective as it is a fully passive system which requires no thermal control and no electronics. Furthermore, the attenuation provided by this innovative two stage damping system can reach a slope up to −80 dB/dec which leads to a Mini-CMG micro-vibration signature lower than similar output torque reaction wheels not equipped with a damping system.",131,,113,122,Engineering; Control moment gyroscope; Torque; Payload; Actuator; Steering law; Vibration; Reaction wheel; Spacecraft; Control theory,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576516301850 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576516301850 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576516301850#! https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AcAau.131..113K/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2016.10.021,,10.1016/j.actaastro.2016.10.021,2537671465,,0,033-126-939-642-649; 048-860-978-700-11X; 075-421-541-166-190; 138-709-866-386-905; 161-076-096-292-246; 172-452-350-723-917,22

Noakes,"<jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>The proposed paper describes the design and operation of a remote sea floor, hybrid rotary-vibracore drill for shallow sampling in the more difficult, densely packed, clay, sand, and gravel deposits. Weighing about 2500 lbs., the system was designed for remote operation from work boats as small as 60 feet. The system is capable of taking a 2 inch core, 16 feet in length.</jats:p>;                   <jats:p>The basic design and operation of the rotary-vibracore drill involves the employment of a dual barrel system whereby the inner-tube functions as the vibracore barrel and the outertube serves as the rotary barrel. The vibracore barrel, driven by a pair of hydraulic rotary vibrators rigidly attached to the barrel, functions as a conventional vibracore, complete with liner and core catcher (as required). The outer rotary barrel is driven by a high torque hydraulic motor via a simple gear train at about 30 rpm. A specially designed bit is attached to the rotary barrel and provides the desired rotary induced, shear effect. This in turn reduces side wall friction on the vibracore barrel and enhances penetration and core recovery. Water is introduced to the annular space between the two barrels via a water swivel mounted between the vibrator and rotary drive sections. This serves to lubricate the barrels, purge sand, and provide water to the rotary bit, at the point of exit.</jats:p>;                   <jats:p>Other design features include a hydraulic cylinder, sheave, and cable arrangement for remote drill system/core barrel assembly pull-out and pull-down. The cylinder hydraulics are also designed so as to bypass on remote command to permit controlled gravity down feed while coring. Also, a fathometer transducer is shock-mounted on the rotary frame (minimal vibration) to provide depth of penetration and penetration rate information.</jats:p>;                   <jats:p>The rotary-vibracore drill is hydraulically powered and electrically actuated. A hydraulic pressure and return hose is deployed from a power supply on the support vessel to a drill frame mounted, remotely controlled distribution valve system. The control valve system container is oil filled and pressure compensated. The electrically actuated control valves are operated via a simple deck-mounted panel, however the system may also be computer controlled.</jats:p>;                   <jats:p>The rotary-vibracore drill was recently tested from the 60 foot work boat, R/V Kit Jones. A core of approximately 14.5 feet was recovered from a section including about 8 feet of loose, silty sand overlying a very dense, desiccated clay. Previous tests at the site with a conventional hydraulic powered vibracore system have yielded only about 1 to 1.5 feet penetration in the dense clay.</jats:p>;                   <jats:p>The successfully tested design provides a compact, low cost, shallow coring system for inshore sampling of the more difficult, densely packed sands, gravels, and clays that typically refuse the conventional vibracore. The system can be operated remotely from low cost work boats of opportunity. The means of rotary cutting the core and introducing the remote pulldown/ pull-out feature insures greater percentage core recovery and the ability to deploy and recover in rougher sea conditions leading to overall savings in time and cost.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>",,,,,Geology; Mining engineering; Drill,,,,,https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-13095-MS,http://dx.doi.org/10.4043/13095-ms,,10.4043/13095-ms,2083903146,,2,,0

Buerger,"This paper describes how parallel elastic elements can be used to reduce energy consumption in the electric-motor-driven, fully actuated, Sandia Transmission-Efficient Prototype Promoting Research (STEPPR) bipedal walking robot without compromising or significantly limiting locomotive behaviors. A physically motivated approach is used to illustrate how selectively engaging springs for hip adduction and ankle flexion predict benefits for three different flat-ground walking gaits: human walking, human-like robot walking, and crouched robot walking. Based on locomotion data, springs are designed and substantial reductions in power consumption are demonstrated using a bench dynamometer. These lessons are then applied to STEPPR, a fully actuated bipedal robot designed to explore the impact of tailored joint mechanisms on walking efficiency. Featuring high-torque brushless DC motors, efficient low-ratio transmissions, and high-fidelity torque control, STEPPR provides the ability to incorporate novel joint-level mechanisms without dramatically altering high-level control. Unique parallel elastic designs are incorporated into STEPPR, and walking data show that hip adduction and ankle flexion springs significantly reduce the required actuator energy at those joints for several gaits. These results suggest that parallel joint springs offer a promising means of supporting quasi-static joint torques due to body mass during walking, relieving motors of the need to support these torques and substantially improving locomotive energy efficiency.",22,2,898,908,Dynamometer; Engineering; Torque; Gait; Actuator; Energy consumption; Simulation; Control theory; Robot kinematics; DC motor; Robot,,,,Sandia National Laboratories; Lockheed Martin Corporation; DARPA's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation (M3) Program; Sandia Corporation; U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7755759 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7755759/ https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/1333717-parallel-elastic-elements-improve-energy-efficiency-steppr-bipedal-walking-robot,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2016.2631170,,10.1109/tmech.2016.2631170,2552147079,,0,001-309-043-271-815; 003-905-605-680-228; 008-088-934-224-332; 008-620-467-718-322; 013-901-222-977-977; 015-294-414-993-251; 018-648-246-947-444; 020-376-215-974-031; 021-519-743-832-274; 022-993-185-366-073; 030-959-777-465-527; 038-621-508-551-307; 038-698-960-184-190; 043-798-162-884-255; 044-840-018-217-848; 056-654-254-433-135; 060-015-331-149-589; 063-119-652-443-928; 069-710-490-688-477; 077-679-102-627-136; 079-978-966-180-047; 089-156-611-660-375; 093-730-133-428-755; 093-952-951-140-159; 098-140-619-833-517; 107-128-286-457-260; 113-037-035-946-549; 115-936-040-026-255; 120-214-664-159-095; 124-288-497-583-282; 125-709-478-190-458; 126-341-581-863-511; 132-970-892-255-993; 138-372-352-639-601; 149-941-686-813-67X; 150-599-054-652-614; 173-551-453-437-657; 187-334-660-501-217,22

The system employs two unidirectional magneto-rheological fluid based brakes and a DC motor. The brakes are coupled to opposite overrunning clutches. By these means, each brake can generate a torque only in a defined direction. Thus, when both a brake and a motor are engaged to constrain the motion of the end-effector, the brake does not block the motor. Theoretical results demonstrate that the system generates less friction and presents less inertia compared to a DC motor associated to an ideal capstan transmission. The proposed control laws determine the shear of efforts between the brakes and the motor in terms of stiffness and energy of the virtual environment, in order to achieve high torque capability while maintaining stability and safety. The control laws do not necessitate a measure of interaction forces. Besides, the design of the actuator and the control laws are completely independent of the virtual environment allowing for the implementation of the system in many different haptic feedback devices.",,,,,Torque; Haptic technology; Actuator; Capstan; Torque density; Brake; Clutch; Computer science; Control theory; DC motor,,,,,http://www.theses.fr/2013PA066700,http://www.theses.fr/2013PA066700,,,236916001,,0,,1

MR-conditional actuations have been widely investigated for development of image-guided and robot-assisted surgical devices under the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This paper presents a simple design of MR-conditional stepper motor which can provide precise and high-torque actuation without adversely affecting the MR image quality. This stepper motor consists of two MR-conditional pneumatic cylinders and the corresponding supporting structures. Alternating the pressurized air can drive the motor to rotate each step in 3.6° with the motor coupled to a planetary gearbox. Experimental studies were conducted to validate its dynamics performance. Maximum 800 mN m output torque is achieved. The motor accuracy independently varied by two factors: motor operating speed and step size, was also investigated. The motor was tested within a 3T Siemens MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) and a 3T GE MRI scanner (GE SignaHDx, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The image artifact and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated for study of its MRI compliancy. The results show that the presented pneumatic stepper motor generated 2.35% SNR reduction in MR images. No observable artifact was presented besides the motor body itself.

This type of actuator is unique with respect to its dynamic properties, as it offers a very high torque but limited angular momentum storage capabilities in comparison to reaction wheels (RWs). In combination with the tetrahedron RW assembly featured on the spacecraft, a unique combination of attitude control actuators has been formed. The spacecraft axis parallel to the FDA is over-actuated, featuring control actuators of contrasting nature which offers novel options in terms of spacecraft operations. However, with the camera axis on TechnoSat being aligned parallel to the actuator’s axis of rotation, there is limited operational use to this setup. In July 2019, TU Berlin launched Berlin Experimental and Educational Satellite 9 (BEESAT-9) – the first CubeSat featuring a set of three orthogonal RWs and a single picosatellite fluid-dynamic actuator (pFDA) for attitude control. The camera axis of BEESAT-9 is perpendicular to the actuator axis, and therefore allows the demonstration of the proposed novel modes of operation. Among the proposed modes is an artificial increase of the swath and the acquisition of stereo images of multiple, successive targets on the ground. Crucial to these operation scenarios is the control allocation between the RW assembly and the single pFDA. This paper first introduces the spacecraft and describes the proposed novel modes of operation that are enabled by the actuator combination realized on BEESAT-9, followed by a review of the state of the art of control allocation for over-actuated spacecraft. The main part of the paper comprises a description of the implementation of the dynamics models of the attitude control actuators and spacecraft, followed by a description of the implemented high-level control laws and control allocation methods. Finally, simulation results for the artificial swath increase and the single spacecraft stereo imaging mode are appended and discussed.",178,,870,880,Aerospace engineering; Attitude control; Actuator; Satellite; Reaction wheel; CubeSat; Stereo imaging; Spacecraft; Computer science; Rotation,,,,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576520306135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.10.018,,10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.10.018,3092553278,,0,050-023-390-750-742; 052-583-799-041-501; 077-117-858-931-619; 101-375-297-171-276,1

Orthotic devices as well as exoskeletons have been widely developed for supporting movement assistance and therapy of patients. Robotic knee orthosis can compensate stiff-knee gait of the paralyzed limb and can provide patients consistent assistance at wearable environments. With keeping a robotic orthosis wearable, however, it is not easy to develop a compact and safe actuator with fast rotation and high torque for consistent supports of patients during walking. In this paper, we propose a novel kinematic model for a robotic knee orthosis to drive a knee joint with independent actuation during swing and stance phases, which can allow an actuator with fast rotation to control swing motions and an actuator with high torque to control stance motions, respectively. The suggested kinematic model is composed of a hamstring device with a slide-crank mechanism, a quadriceps device with five-bar/six-bar links, and a patella device for knee covering. The quadriceps device operates in five-bar links with 2-dof motions during swing phase and is changed to six-bar links during stance phase by the contact motion to the patella device. The hamstring device operates in a slider-crank mechanism for entire gait cycle. The kinematics and velocity/force relations are analyzed for the quadriceps and hamstring devices. Finally, the adequate actuators for the suggested kinematic model are designed based on normal gait requirements. The suggested kinematic model will allow a robotic knee orthosis to use compact and light actuators with full support during walking.",17,8,814,823,Engineering; Exoskeleton; Gait; Actuator; Hamstring; Orthotic device; Knee Joint; Kinematics; Simulation; Swing,,,,,http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=JOJDCV_2011_v17n8_814,http://dx.doi.org/10.5302/j.icros.2011.17.8.814,,10.5302/j.icros.2011.17.8.814,2075934528,,0,006-414-294-802-955; 009-040-055-543-621; 012-927-252-818-247; 023-360-950-534-182; 093-905-311-119-886,3

The paper begins with the design of a two-dimensional airfoil model with the piecewise-linear torsional stiffness in pitch direction and a control surface driven by an ultrasonic motor. Then, it gives the experimental modeling of the airfoil section and the servo, composed of the control surface and the ultrasonic motor, as well as the identification of system parameters through the use of a simple approach of nonlinear least squares estimation. Afterwards, the paper presents the dynamic equation of the aeroservoelastic equation based on Theodorsen's aerodynamic load, and the numerical simulations for the sub-optimal control of flutter.

Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (Cat. No.99TH8465),,IEEE,,Kiyoshi Ohishi; H. Nozawa; Toshimasa Miyazaki,"As each joint actuator of a robot manipulator has a limit value of torque, the motion control system should consider the torque saturation. Since the redundant robot manipulator has plural attitudes for a position of its end-effector. Jacobian matrix of redundant robot manipulator can select the optimal one considering its motion energy. Using the optimal Jacobian matrix, the motion control system can fairly consider the torque saturation in steady state. When the motion control system carries out fast motion and quick disturbance suppression, high joint torque is required in the transient state. However, the high torque cannot often be produced by torque limitation. In order to consider the torque saturation in the steady and transient states, this paper proposes a new redundant motion control system, which uses both the autonomous consideration algorithm on torque saturation and the optimal Jacobian matrix on motion energy. The proposed Jacobian matrix minimizes the motion energy of joint space in steady state. The autonomous consideration algorithm on torque saturation adjusts the acceleration torque in joint space, and compensates the saturation effect in Cartesian space. In the simulation results, on condition of having a large payload torque and a fast motion reference, the proposed redundant manipulator control well realizes the quick robot motion robustly and smoothly.",1,,145,150,Algorithm; Acceleration; Engineering; Torque; Motion control; Cartesian coordinate system; Actuator; Jacobian matrix and determinant; Robust control; Control theory; Transient state,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/801774/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isie.1999.801774,,10.1109/isie.1999.801774,1821299349,,0,019-013-667-766-489; 028-863-386-814-277; 044-025-815-598-929; 085-393-779-263-553; 132-885-325-103-241; 167-674-857-020-519,10

Gregg,"In this article, we present the design of a powered knee–ankle prosthetic leg, which implements high-torque actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible benefits over modern actuation styles in emerging robotic prosthetic legs, which include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, less acoustic noise, and power regeneration. Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques ( $\sim$ 1–3 N $\cdot$ m) and confirm the small reflected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufficiently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. Finally, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reflected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power consumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-the-art powered legs.",36,6,1649,1668,Inertia; Torque; Noise; Mechanical impedance; Actuator; Electrical impedance; Impedance control; Computer science; Control theory; Wave impedance,actuator design; backdrivability; powered prostheses; rehabilitation robotics,,,NICHD NIH HHS (DP2 HD080349) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R01 HD094772) United States,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139298 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33299386/ http://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2020.3005533 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299386 https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2020.3005533 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/trob/trob36.html#EleryRNG20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tro.2020.3005533,33299386,10.1109/tro.2020.3005533; 10.1109/icra.2018.8461259,2890566160,PMC7720653,0,000-562-467-956-781; 000-988-073-087-622; 001-108-277-681-322; 001-831-403-882-161; 002-601-983-210-638; 004-042-350-974-085; 005-011-900-779-140; 005-086-293-779-574; 006-448-094-903-589; 006-627-158-464-751; 008-589-158-200-885; 009-954-697-976-892; 015-183-015-105-630; 018-414-286-727-823; 019-522-356-407-951; 023-675-602-629-405; 023-695-429-703-605; 027-042-476-807-869; 029-356-414-169-747; 029-736-658-558-436; 032-934-482-667-502; 034-704-424-592-37X; 034-941-037-494-939; 035-313-643-526-717; 038-001-065-352-618; 040-829-222-806-890; 040-930-220-052-585; 041-971-216-646-150; 049-337-231-626-724; 049-632-583-899-357; 051-614-035-217-960; 054-210-583-551-861; 054-405-518-434-474; 055-048-293-513-625; 056-268-899-315-990; 057-491-095-707-321; 059-579-998-080-100; 059-605-523-796-718; 060-038-111-221-034; 062-079-694-032-393; 062-729-539-311-589; 063-028-411-039-832; 063-192-221-637-342; 063-522-950-915-68X; 063-613-333-902-908; 066-172-323-756-730; 066-278-879-962-199; 066-548-658-422-946; 066-704-358-267-552; 069-146-373-620-401; 072-445-523-896-250; 074-689-531-037-45X; 075-188-089-834-229; 077-553-242-127-172; 077-952-042-020-897; 078-367-782-293-865; 081-905-771-716-010; 082-410-385-599-356; 090-545-459-868-968; 096-334-259-308-470; 107-096-910-931-285; 108-088-556-944-775; 109-482-389-013-843; 110-220-919-398-476; 110-573-567-224-563; 115-936-040-026-255; 116-984-408-081-838; 122-195-675-294-964; 129-293-051-107-888; 132-207-464-968-082; 132-217-117-624-161; 135-546-576-740-547; 146-619-449-282-84X; 175-129-862-116-466; 189-041-197-207-510; 194-845-418-945-168,24

The purpose of the control system is to maintain the device in a vertical position which is the unstable equilibrium point. The angle of rotation of the flywheel is measured by an incremental encoder.

Venturini; F. Leonardi,"An approach to joint actuation for space applications is presented. This electric actuator is capable of directly operating a robot arm, with the low speed, high torque, good smoothness, and intrinsic safety brake ability required by a typical space application. The actuator consists of a PM (permanent magnet) brushless motor and a high-efficiency magnetic gearbox built into the motor airgap, with no backlash but finite stiffness and quasisinusoidal torque vs. position characteristic. A complete finite element analysis has been carried out to verify the mechanical feasibility and to optimize the actuator design. The test design, with total mass of 3 kg including the sensor, reaches a torque density greater than 9 Nm/kg with an overall motor plus reducer efficiency of 63% at 150 W power level. >",,,37,42,Torque sensor; Direct torque control; Rotary actuator; Engineering; Torque; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Valve actuator; Torque motor; Torque density; Control theory,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/298900/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ias.1993.298900,,10.1109/ias.1993.298900,2162123455,,2,003-670-085-878-13X; 078-084-216-034-455; 096-847-527-711-615; 154-627-161-630-163,23

The electrical and operating considerations of a photovoltaic module include total solar irradiation, maximum generated power by the system, voltage, open-circuit voltage, current, short circuit current, cell temperature, and ambient temperature.; To find sun’s position in the sky LDRs (light dependent resistors) are used as an input feedback and rotate the PV module to track the sun using motors and actuators. Quantity of four LDRs mounted on the solar tracking system frame used to find the light intension difference between all four directions north, south, east and west. The system is automatically controlled by PLC system and is able to rotate the photovoltaic module to follow altitude angle of the sun between 0o to 90o using a 24 inches 36V DC actuator and a 12V high torque DC motor is used to rotate the photovoltaic module toward east and west to follow the sun’s azimuth angle for 360 degrees.; The results show that most of the solar irradiance value is dissipated and not entered to the PV module. However, this dissipation of energy results in decreasing the value of the energy and exergy input to the system. The increase in the value of the energy and exergy losses from the morning to about the noon time is because of increasing of the surface temperature of the solar module. From the output of this work, the authors suggested that the module should be reconstructed and redesigned which is suitable for the Kurdistan environment. The suitable one of the PV is to be designed in a way that the temperature rise within the module is not increased the standard level which is 25 oC, however the temperature rise is will reach about 50 oC in the summer. That is why the authors prefer to reconstruct the module.",20,1,381,393,Exergy; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Dissipation; Resistor; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Nominal power (photovoltaic); Photovoltaic system; Solar irradiance,,,,,http://journal.uod.ac/index.php/uodjournal/article/view/48,http://dx.doi.org/10.26682/sjuod.2017.20.1.35,,10.26682/sjuod.2017.20.1.35,2740950190,,0,,0

Rehabilitation is the process of regaining the muscle movement by repeating the hand movement artificially. In this contemporary research, an Exo-glove and Exo-arm were fabricated and tested which will allow mobility and rehabilitation of fingers as well as the arm. Bowden cables are used to perform force transmission and are affixed to the fingers with the help of 3-D printed guides. The Exo-arm comprises a servo motor attached to a 4 bar link mechanism. The system is controlled by a joystick analog input. A 5kg-cm servo motor is used to actuate the fingers via the cable mechanism which enables flexibility. The cable is wound around a pulley of 9cm diameter and is mounted on the housing to maintain the tension of the cable. The arm was actuated using a 20kg-cm servo motor that drives the link mechanism and conveys a force to move the forearm.

However, the motor used in this application displays nonlinear behavior due to the necessary contact between its rotor and stator.

To make exoskeletons more accessible to patients, they need to be lightweight and compact without major performance tradeoffs. Existing upper limb exoskeletons focus on assistance with coarse motion of the upper arm, whereas forearm fine-motion rehabilitation is often ignored. This paper presents an elbow-wrist exoskeleton with five degrees of freedom (DoFs). Using geared bearings, slider crank mechanisms, and a spherical mechanism for the wrist and elbow modules, this exoskeleton can provide 5-DoF rotary motion forearm assistance. The optimized exoskeleton dimensions allow sufficient rotation output while the motors are placed parallel to the forearm and elbow joint. Thus, compactness and less inertia loading can be achieved. Linear and rotary series elastic actuators with high torque-to-weight ratios are proposed to accurately measure and control interaction force and impedance between exoskeleton and forearm. The resulting 3-kg exoskeleton can be used alone or easily in combination with other exoskeleton robots to provide various robot-aided upper limb rehabilitation.",24,6,2684,2695,Torque; Exoskeleton; Actuator; Wrist; Forearm; Elbow; Computer science; Simulation; Rotation around a fixed axis; Robot,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/zh/publications/a-5-degrees-of-freedom-lightweight-elbow-wrist-exoskeleton-for-fo https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8859332/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2019.2945491,,10.1109/tmech.2019.2945491,2977642584,,0,001-763-462-932-884; 007-697-518-379-797; 009-358-378-504-010; 011-185-922-732-244; 011-665-134-964-32X; 016-442-335-525-466; 022-168-109-835-368; 023-531-249-854-51X; 025-376-193-886-445; 048-593-421-751-602; 052-019-025-481-67X; 054-656-447-148-249; 058-125-938-774-482; 059-619-238-649-804; 062-509-501-177-367; 072-109-918-436-133; 072-375-775-094-798; 074-348-561-561-580; 080-059-985-981-331; 083-238-102-200-259; 133-624-291-042-225; 142-564-742-100-709; 143-577-936-346-140; 166-182-927-247-800,3

First, the proposed high torque density actuation comprised of our customized high-torque density motors and low ratio transmission mechanism significantly reduces the mass of the robot and produces high backdrivability. Second, we derive a biomechanics model-based control that generates assistive torque profile for versatile control of both squat and stoop lifting assistance. The control algorithm detects lifting postures using compact inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to generate an assistive profile that is proportional to the human joint torque produced from our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot exhibits low mechanical impedance (1.5 Nm backdrive torque) when it is unpowered and 0.5 Nm backdrive torque with zero-torque tracking control. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking is less than 0.29 Nm (1.21% error of 24 Nm peak torque). Compared with squatting without the exoskeleton, the controller reduces 87.5%, 80% and 75% of the three knee extensor muscles (average peak EMG of 3 healthy subjects) during squat with 50% of human joint torque assistance.",4,4,4579,4586,Torque; Exoskeleton; Mechanical impedance; Biomechanics; Squat; Backdrive; Computer science; Simulation; Inertial measurement unit; Control theory,,,,"National Science Foundation; Grove School of Engineering, The City University of New York, City College",https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ral/ral4.html#YuHWLSSPTS19 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8777108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/lra.2019.2931427,,10.1109/lra.2019.2931427,2965172846,,0,000-029-747-488-93X; 000-106-910-658-705; 006-077-695-687-172; 008-589-158-200-885; 022-025-120-812-388; 023-360-950-534-182; 027-304-971-477-489; 028-862-609-405-071; 030-507-157-672-704; 031-787-433-355-55X; 033-764-495-058-252; 034-120-902-544-673; 038-512-819-535-096; 038-721-557-967-796; 039-416-036-089-129; 041-136-103-127-355; 043-335-472-372-203; 049-382-397-989-800; 049-450-488-325-69X; 049-605-800-281-032; 052-718-154-842-091; 054-028-823-446-315; 054-943-873-543-614; 056-353-641-915-733; 059-579-998-080-100; 060-359-253-947-452; 061-766-059-004-893; 071-519-097-814-664; 075-483-804-565-42X; 080-353-214-955-001; 104-075-675-651-256; 106-527-885-911-500; 107-096-910-931-285; 131-012-749-762-989; 137-267-778-313-325; 142-620-654-763-338; 171-657-287-635-73X,8

Thus, we focus on designing the motion transmission mechanism and torque amplifier of the motor. The designed motion transmission mechanism that functions to convert the contraction/expansion of the SMA wires to rotational motion enables the motor to generate continuous rotation with relatively short-length SMA wires. Additionally, a double-disc cycloidal speed reducer designed as the torque amplifier allows the motor to reliably generate high torque with a compact structure due to its simple configuration, size variability, and torque amplification functionality. One of the advantages of the motor is that an actuating module could be additionally incorporated into the motor to achieve higher torque. In this case, the overall size and weight of the motor are marginally increased although the output torque capacity almost doubles. Hence, the energy density of the motor significantly increases.

The advantage of designing a machine with directly driven system is to eliminate the intermediate gear box system with having minor component count and reduced jamming possibility. The proposed design of DS hybrid excitation with high torque density is investigated in this paper as a potential solution for aircraft applications.  The key intentions of the design are high level of actuator integration to reduce the overall weight and volume and fault tolerance ability. The proposed design of DS HESFSM has simple structure, which consist of only six field excitation coils (FECs) housed in outer stator along with six armature coils (ACs) whereas, six permanent magnets (PMs) are positioned in the inner stator. Moreover, DS HESFM structure is analyzed at open circuit and short circuit conditions conditions by means of “commercial 2D FEA package, JMAG-designer ver. 14.0,” released by JSOL Corporation.</jats:p>",7,4.30,411,,Magnetic flux; Actuator; Acoustics; Computer science,,,,,https://www.sciencepubco.com/index.php/ijet/article/viewFile/22347/10951,http://dx.doi.org/10.14419/ijet.v7i4.30.22347,,10.14419/ijet.v7i4.30.22347,2942004913,,0,,1

Dai,"Nonlinear stiffness actuators with coupled stiffness and load can achieve a tradeoff between high bandwidth in high stiffness and high torque resolution in low stiffness, but numerous studies have focused on the implementation of novel mechanical actuator structures with nonlinear stiffness rather than optimization of the stiffness values to improve the actuator performances. Designing the optimal stiffness profile to simultaneously achieve increased control bandwidth and torque resolution is a critical problem that needs to be resolved. This paper investigates this problem, proposes a quantized comprehensive performance index the perceptivity and responsiveness index (PRI), and achieves increased control bandwidth and torque resolution using a common feedback controller. Minimizing PRI enables nonlinear stiffness actuators to achieve optimal stiffness profiles. Afterward, an optimal stiffness curve and corresponding feedback control gains are obtained for a load-dependent nonlinear stiffness actuator (LDNSA) based on the proposed methodology. Simulations and experiments based on the LDNSA are conducted at the optimal stiffness to verify the proposed method. Remarkably, the results show that the LDNSA with optimal stiffness yields high comprehensive performance including increased bandwidth in the case of low stiffness and increased torque resolution in the cases of large load.",67,4,2925,2935,Torque; Actuator; Stiffness; Feedback controller; High bandwidth; Nonlinear stiffness; Feedback control; Computer science; Control theory; Bandwidth (signal processing),,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Department Program; International Collaboration Programme,http://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2910053 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tie/tie67.html#ZhaoSMD20 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8694015 https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2019.2910053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tie.2019.2910053,,10.1109/tie.2019.2910053,2941932431,,0,004-286-262-526-080; 008-277-296-769-591; 015-710-131-847-334; 021-232-587-835-538; 022-283-915-605-763; 023-710-537-123-475; 027-043-942-434-540; 028-082-006-373-78X; 028-353-929-487-939; 029-572-107-293-840; 030-258-766-754-647; 030-457-145-259-637; 036-144-071-965-926; 039-458-780-295-794; 043-798-162-884-255; 043-832-121-917-723; 052-327-825-596-429; 054-421-134-447-76X; 067-846-934-666-747; 073-829-087-995-330; 075-221-655-207-214; 081-857-010-960-541; 082-633-118-124-012; 084-815-799-458-121; 088-955-483-345-593; 098-139-366-478-546; 099-625-839-539-768; 109-127-862-858-758; 115-806-354-740-309; 123-016-907-456-847; 123-967-760-609-733; 125-020-936-156-282; 151-803-808-575-11X; 156-975-925-791-666; 158-054-998-493-981; 174-686-820-381-54X,2

Leahy; Kimon P. Valavanis; George N. Saridis,"The first step in the creation of a robotic manipulator controller performance database has been completed. Experimental evaluation of the trajectory-tracking performance of a PUM-600 under computed-torque control has provided valuable engineering insight into the role of dynamics compensation for manipulators with high torque amplification drive systems. Experimental results validate the assumptions that Coriolis and centrifugal forces are negligible and actuator dynamics play a central role in manipulator dynamics. Without complete modeling of the drive-system dynamics, computed-torque trajectory-tracking accuracy was inadequate for gross motion control. It is concluded that more accurate representation of the real robot system dynamics is required for realistic simulation of modern control algorithms and improved real-time performance. >",5,2,242,245,Engineering; Control engineering; Motion control; Actuator; Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly; Industrial robot; Dynamic models; Centrifugal force; Control theory; Control theory; Robot,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/trob/trob5.html#LeahyVS89 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/88046/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/70.88046,,10.1109/70.88046,2143031671,,0,000-014-499-172-327; 007-590-967-130-743; 008-326-289-539-163; 021-664-873-433-600; 023-098-750-024-558; 028-268-813-502-109; 058-513-120-410-708; 060-501-509-863-848; 060-906-870-927-22X; 076-837-338-150-244; 086-240-908-338-208; 089-137-816-826-654; 112-372-231-215-358; 116-934-850-195-947; 130-438-694-969-529; 153-199-584-723-762; 157-627-650-107-882,32

The rotor operates with a single phase sub-five volt peak-to-peak excitation in atmospheric pressure. The piezoelectric plate is adhesively mounted making the method suitable for actuating micromachines from any surface micromachine process. Two different modes of operation are demonstrated: pulsed and resonant. The pulse actuation results in low rotation rate (0.5-3 RPM) while resonant actuation results in a fast rotation (10-100 RPM).

Today's conventional space drive systems are made from off-the-shelf actuators and multistage transmissions that generally involve three to six stages. This current practice has certain benefits such as short development time due to the availability of mechanical components. However, it lacks a system-level integration that accounts for the actuator structure, size and output force, transmission structure, gear-ratio, and strength, and often leads to long and bulky assemblies with large number of parts. This paper presents a new robotic hardware that integrates the robot's JDS into one compact device that is optimized for its size and maximum torque density. This is done by designing the robotic joint using a special transmission which, when numerically optimized, can produce unlimited gear-ratios using only two stages. The design is computerized to obtain all the solutions that satisfy its kinematic relationships within a given actuator diameter. Compared to existing robotic actuators, the proposed design could lead to shorter assemblies with significantly lower number of parts for the same output torque. The theoretical results demonstrates the potential of an example device, for which a proof-of-concept plastic mockup was fabricated, that could deliver more than 200 N·m of torque in a package as small as a human elbow joint. The proposed technology could have strong technological implications in other industries such as powered prosthetics and rehabilitation equipment.</jats:p>",9,6,061002,,Bearing (mechanical); Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Artificial intelligence; Actuator; High torque; Robotics; Robot,,,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2648722 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanismsrobotics/article/9/6/061002/377570/Design-and-Development-of-a-Compact-High-Torque http://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2648722,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4037567,,10.1115/1.4037567,2744123615,,0,002-005-295-668-29X; 007-484-485-001-181; 014-465-952-277-815; 016-087-845-844-842; 016-876-178-862-757; 021-664-873-433-600; 023-377-809-181-630; 023-695-429-703-605; 023-795-229-830-675; 024-229-919-149-836; 038-630-783-440-42X; 038-921-565-140-058; 041-766-193-573-944; 043-516-265-046-838; 057-116-948-519-062; 059-379-028-599-44X; 078-746-158-726-866; 085-622-040-090-291; 086-753-610-559-618; 090-942-357-755-697; 099-239-582-059-375; 110-573-567-224-563; 111-773-990-365-438; 124-530-603-903-095; 178-683-307-193-240,4

Following the injury,; limitations of the ability to move may occur due to the disruption of the motor and sensory functions; of the nervous system depending on the severity of the lesion. An active stance-control; knee-ankle-foot orthosis was developed and tested in earlier works to aid incomplete SCI subjects; by increasing their mobility and independence. This thesis aims at the incorporation of; elastic actuation into the active orthosis to utilise advantages of the compliant system regarding; efficiency and human-robot interaction as well as the reproduction of the phyisological compliance; of the human joints. Therefore, a model-based procedure is adapted to the design of; an elastic actuation system for a gait-assisitve active orthosis. A determination of the optimal; structure and parameters is undertaken via optimisation of models representing compliant actuators; with increasing level of detail. The minimisation of the energy calculated from the positive; amount of power or from the absolute power of the actuator generating one human-like gait cycle; yields an optimal series stiffness, which is similar to the physiological stiffness of the human; knee during the stance phase. Including efficiency factors for components, especially the consideration; of the electric model of an electric motor yields additional information. A human-like; gait cycle contains high torque and low velocities in the stance phase and lower torque combined; with high velocities during the swing. Hence, the efficiency of an electric motor with a gear unit; is only high in one of the phases. This yields a conceptual design of a series elastic actuator with; locking of the actuator position during the stance phase. The locked position combined with the; series compliance allows a reproduction of the characteristics of the human gait cycle during; the stance phase. Unlocking the actuator position for the swing phase enables the selection of; an optimal gear ratio to maximise the recuperable energy. To evaluate the developed concept,; a laboratory specimen based on an electric motor, a harmonic drive gearbox, a torsional series; spring and an electromagnetic brake is designed and appropriate components are selected. A; control strategy, based on impedance control, is investigated and extended with a finite state; machine to activate the locking mechanism. The control scheme and the laboratory specimen; are implemented at a test bench, modelling the foot and shank as a pendulum articulated at the; knee. An identification of parameters yields high and nonlinear friction as a problem of the system,; which reduces the energy efficiency of the system and requires appropriate compensation.; A comparison between direct and elastic actuation shows similar results for both systems at the; test bench, showing that the increased complexity due to the second degree of freedom and; the elastic behaviour of the actuator is treated properly. The final proof of concept requires the; implementation at the active orthosis to emulate uncertainties and variations occurring during; the human gait.",,,,,Pendulum; Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Electric motor; Test bench; Harmonic drive; Impedance control; Gait (human); Simulation; Control theory,,,,,https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/99495,https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/99495,,,2590389532,,0,,0

Mangrulkar,"Abstract The Electro-Pneumatic Actuators (EPAs) using ON/OFF type solenoid valves are very popular in aerospace applications due to their robustness, simplicity, high Torque/Weight ratio, fast speed of response, etc. This paper deals with the modeling, simulation, plant characterization, design of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Controller and model validation of an EPA used in missile applications. The EPA used in this work consists of 3-way, 2-position, ON-OFF type solenoid valves. A non-linear mathematical model of the EPA has been developed and implemented in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment to carry out the simulation studies.

SteinetzStructural Dynamics BranchNASA Lewis Research CenterABSTRACTNASA Lewis Research Center recently began a research program to investigatemechanism positioning systems that would be suitable for space vehicles. High-torque-density efficient systems are required that operate smoothly withoutmechanical backlash and without liquid lubrication systems. Roller drivesinherently have many of these required properties because power is transmittedthrough continuously rolling drive elements. The roller-driven mechanismsinvestigated range from a smooth dry-running drive designed for the SpaceStation alpha joint (Loewenthal and Schuller, 1986) to a backlash-free tractionrobot joint tested in NASA's telerobotic research program (Kuban and Williams,1987).This paper presents results of a test program that evaluated the stiffness,accuracy, and torque ripple of a 16:1, 320-ft-lb planetary roller drive for apotential space vehicle actuator application.The drive's planet roller supporting structure and bearings were found to bethe largest contributors to overall drive compliance (reciprocal of stiffness),accounting for more than half of the total. In comparison, the traction rollercontacts contributed only 9 percent of the drive compliance based on an experi-mentally verified stiffness model. The drive exhibited no backlash although8 arc sec of hysteresis deflection were recorded because of microcreep withinthe contact under torque load. Because of these load-dependent displacements,some form of feedback control would be required for arc-second positioningapplications. Torque ripple tests showed the drive to be extremely smooth,actually providing some damping of input torsional oscillations.1-175https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19880013855 2020-07-14T20:02:14+00:00Z",,,,,Deflection (engineering); Bearing (mechanical); Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Backlash; Torque ripple; Clutch; Torsion (mechanics); Control theory; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/146327 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19870006903 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19880013855.pdf,https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/146327,,,1512060723,,0,009-231-511-307-756; 013-960-508-376-819; 046-516-255-478-273; 076-209-508-127-876; 106-149-900-832-734; 110-869-532-930-612; 112-284-246-966-269; 120-436-310-557-903; 133-042-275-423-933; 143-725-162-832-007; 178-170-019-612-11X,2

Ruzbehi; I. Hahn,"In conventional optimization, geometric optimization with changing the boundaries of the geometric shape is common, but in this study, topological optimization is applied to give the designer more freedom to achieve a machine design, which fulfils the customer’s goals. Topological optimization is common in the field of mechanical engineering, but in the design of electrical machines and electromagnetic actuators there is still an open space for its application.Having an electrical machine with high torque and low weight is one of the desired goals, which is investigated in this study. The implementation of the proposed method is applied to an electromagnetic actuator in order to optimize its topology or structure. To assess the validity of the proposed method, while considering the goals, the design of a simple magnetic actuator using a metaheuristic optimization method is presented as a global search. To overcome the generation of intermediate material characteristics in the cells of the design area, a binary genetic algorithm (GA) is used. Also, to enhance the low convergence rate of the GA, several chromosomes for each subarea of the design space are used independently of each other and operate at the same time, therefore, lead to a significant reduction of the computational time. The actuator’s force is calculated to gain the best material distribution in the discretized design area. After the automatic optimization process some manual changes in the material distribution are made to improve the manufacturability. The given design goals have been successfully achieved using the proposed topological optimization method.",,,,,Global optimization; Actuator; Topology optimization; Computer science; Rate of convergence; Design for manufacturability; Control theory; Discretization; Geometric shape; Genetic algorithm,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=9032829 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9027809/9032720/09032829.pdf?arnumber=9032829,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/compumag45669.2019.9032829,,10.1109/compumag45669.2019.9032829,3011240538,,0,020-278-725-509-528; 033-942-640-720-599; 043-512-935-400-659; 058-182-104-151-554; 063-627-471-964-530; 153-966-887-855-337; 166-244-551-896-095,1

To develop multi-dof wrist mechanisms that can emulate human wrists, compactness and high torque density are the major challenges. Traditional wrist mechanisms consist of series of rotary motors that require gearing to amplify the output torque. This often results in a bulky wrist mechanism. Instead, large linear force can be easily realized in a compact space by using leadscrew motors. Inspired by the muscle-tendon actuation pattern, the proposed mechanism consists of two parallel placed linear motors. Their linear motions are transmitted to two perpendicular rotations through a spherical mechanism and two slider crank mechanisms. High torque density can be achieved. Static and dynamic models are developed to design the wrist mechanism. A wrist prototype and its position control experiments will be presented with results discussed.

State-of-the-art actuators, e.g., series elastic actuators (SEAs), have to compromise bandwidth to improve compliance (i.e., backdrivability). In this paper, we describe the design and human-robot interaction modeling of a portable hip exoskeleton based on our custom quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuation (i.e., a high torque density motor with low ratio gear). We also present a model-based performance benchmark comparison of representative actuators in terms of torque capability, control bandwidth, backdrivability, and force tracking accuracy. This paper aims to corroborate the underlying philosophy of ""design for control"", namely meticulous robot design can simplify control algorithms while ensuring high performance. Following this idea, we create a lightweight bilateral hip exoskeleton (overall mass is 3.4 kg) to reduce joint loadings during normal activities, including walking and squatting. Experimental results indicate that the exoskeleton is able to produce high nominal torque (17.5 Nm), high backdrivability (0.4 Nm backdrive torque), high bandwidth (62.4 Hz), and high control accuracy (1.09 Nm root mean square tracking error, i.e., 5.4% of the desired peak torque). Its controller is versatile to assist walking at different speeds (0.8-1.4 m/s) and squatting at 2 s cadence. This work demonstrates significant improvement in backdrivability and control bandwidth compared with state-of-the-art exoskeletons powered by the conventional actuation or SEA.",,,,,Torque; Exoskeleton; Actuator; Cadence; Backdrive; Torque density; Computer science; Simulation; Bandwidth (signal processing); Control theory,,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00467.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2004.00467 https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00467,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00467.pdf,,,3014168494,,0,001-999-863-645-916; 008-589-158-200-885; 010-121-316-072-574; 010-777-751-969-994; 018-414-286-727-823; 020-545-402-836-122; 021-288-936-544-679; 031-000-085-926-720; 033-193-891-520-166; 033-764-495-058-252; 035-076-593-288-725; 039-416-036-089-129; 043-335-472-372-203; 046-238-252-906-773; 048-107-822-216-68X; 050-834-942-107-202; 058-579-099-778-218; 059-914-744-284-061; 062-116-502-528-694; 068-362-768-833-268; 069-490-448-744-04X; 071-519-097-814-664; 072-375-775-094-798; 073-086-152-214-672; 075-800-515-935-187; 079-165-752-195-253; 079-438-653-229-201; 104-075-675-651-256; 107-096-910-931-285; 113-162-718-091-319; 116-292-263-271-034; 121-279-254-706-563; 124-299-791-179-495; 125-569-817-686-190; 130-402-077-250-151; 131-012-749-762-989; 131-180-103-287-456; 142-854-766-191-33X,0

Using multiple actuators for one driving axis is one of the possible solutions; however, there is an associated problem of output power matching. This study proposes a new active joint mechanism using multiple actuators. Because the actuator is made of a flexible bag, it does not interfere with other actuators when it is depressurized. The proposed joint achieved coordinated motion of multiple actuators. This report also discusses a new actuator which has dual cylindrical structure. The cylinders are composed of flexible bags with different diameters. The joint torque is estimated based on the following factors: empirical formula for the flexible actuator torque, geometric relationship between the joint and the actuator, and the principle of virtual work. The prototype joint mechanism achieves coordinated motion of multiple actuators for one axis.

Wensing; Albert Wang; Sangok Seok; David M. Otten; Jeffrey H. Lang; Sangbae Kim,"Designing an actuator system for highly dynamic legged robots has been one of the grand challenges in robotics research. Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability. We introduce a new metric named the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.",33,3,509,522,Modal analysis; Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Artificial intelligence; Actuator; Robotics; Simulation; Bounding overwatch; DC motor; Contact force; Robot,,,,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7827048 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7827048 https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2016.2640183 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/trob/trob33.html#WensingWSOLK17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tro.2016.2640183,,10.1109/tro.2016.2640183,2573227850,,0,003-071-614-172-104; 003-543-235-710-147; 005-192-172-363-782; 010-992-031-579-738; 011-990-817-425-850; 014-175-589-645-98X; 015-798-724-448-67X; 021-995-315-857-050; 023-695-429-703-605; 029-498-453-091-43X; 030-090-725-361-023; 031-036-932-505-682; 034-099-373-389-060; 038-045-068-317-898; 043-798-162-884-255; 044-002-931-107-187; 044-770-212-095-097; 053-215-127-004-836; 056-268-899-315-990; 061-117-295-135-801; 065-704-595-373-037; 073-270-294-317-861; 091-990-111-925-804; 093-427-338-137-335; 093-996-637-417-441; 096-337-651-080-777; 096-893-025-648-377; 111-935-217-527-451; 115-936-040-026-255; 116-814-572-068-959; 120-142-143-660-407; 120-849-882-277-494; 130-556-749-524-613; 134-127-010-216-866; 161-652-740-351-781; 172-756-753-773-620; 178-152-451-746-02X; 186-054-222-366-702,108

Orthotic devices as well as exoskeletons have been widely developed for supporting movement assistance and therapy of patients. Robotic knee orthosis can compensate stiff-knee gait of the paralyzed limb and can provide patients consistent assistance at wearable environments. With keeping a robotic orthosis wearable, however, it is not easy to develop a compact and safe actuator with fast rotation and high torque for consistent supports of patients during walking. In this paper, we propose a novel kinematic model for a robotic knee orthosis to drive a knee joint with independent actuation during swing and stance phases, which can allow an actuator with fast rotation to control swing motions and an actuator with high torque to control stance motions, respectively. The suggested kinematic model is composed of a hamstring device with a slide-crank mechanism, a quadriceps device with five-bar/six-bar links, and a patella device for knee covering. The quadriceps device operates in five-bar links with 2-dof motions during swing phase and is changed to six-bar links during stance phase by the contact motion to the patella device. The hamstring device operates in a slider-crank mechanism for entire gait cycle. The kinematics and velocity/force relations are analyzed for the quadriceps and hamstring devices. Finally, the adequate actuators for the suggested kinematic model are designed based on normal gait requirements.

060-624-705-469-91X,Ventiltriebkonzepte zur Verbrauchsreduzierung bei Motorradmotoren,,2013,dissertation,,,,,Giovanni Mincione,"In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird das Verbrauchspotential bei Motorradmotoren von zwei variablen Ventiltrieben, dem mechanischen vollvariablen Ventiltrieb (VVT) und dem Schaltnockensystem (SN) verglichen. Im fur den Abgastest relevanten TL-Bereich werden zwei Betriebspunkte mit niedriger und hoher Last fur die stationaren Untersuchungen definiert. Fur die Darstellung des entdrosselten Betriebs wird die Ventilhubstrategie mit fruhem Einlass Schliesen (FES) gewahlt. Die zu untersuchenden Ventilhubprofile werden durch Verkurzung der Offnungsdauer (OD) der Basisnocke unter Beibehaltung der maximalen Ventilbeschleunigung generiert.; Die rechnerischen Ergebnisse in der unteren Teillast zeigen, dass sowohl kurze (ca. 40% der Basis-OD) als auch mittellange (ca. 70% der Basis-OD) Ventilhubprofile zu einem vollentdrosselten Betrieb mit gravierender Absenkung der Ladungswechselverluste fuhren. Stark unterschiedlich ist aber der sich ergebende Restgasgehalt, der bei mittellangen Hubprofilen auf hoherem Niveau liegt. ; Im oberen Teillastbereich zeigen die Simulationen ebenfalls einen deutlichen Effekt der Entdrosselung auf die Ladungswechselverluste, wobei das allgemein niedrige Restgasgehaltniveau weniger beeinflusst wird. ; Die Verbrennungsstabilitat in der unteren Teillast stellt bei Motorradmotoren, aufgrund ihrer speziellen konstruktiven Eigenschaften, eine grose Herausforderung dar. Daruber hinaus fuhrt der FES-Ansatz zu einer Absenkung des Turbulenzniveaus im Brennraum sowie des effektiven Verdichtungsverhaltnisses. Mittels dreidimensionaler Stromungssimulation werden verschiedene Masnahmen analysiert, die fur eine Verstarkung der Ladungsbewegung sorgen. ; Die experimentellen Ergebnisse im unteren TL-Bereich bestatigen, dass Hubprofile mit kurzer OD bei Vollentdrosselung zu einer gravierenden Absenkung der Ladungswechselarbeit fuhren (VVT-Ansatz). Hubprofile mit mittellanger OD sind im vollentdrosselten Betrieb nicht zielfuhrend, da die Verbrennungsstabilitat aufgrund des hohen Restgasgehalts und des niedrigen Turbulenzniveaus sehr kritisch wird. Diese Hubprofile konnen aber als SN-Varianten ohne Einsatz eines Einlassphasenstellers mit spaterer Einlassspreizung und angestellter Drosselklappe betrieben werden. Dies fuhrt zu einer hervorragenden Verbrennungsstabilitat und dadurch erreichen die SN-Hubprofile ebenfalls einen Verbrauchsvorteil gegenuber der Basisnocke. Die geringe Reibleistung, die sich aus dem reduzierten Ventilhub ergibt, wirkt sich in der unteren Teillast zusatzlich auf den Kraftstoffverbrauch aus. In Summe zeigen die SN-Hubprofile eine Verbrauchseinsparung von 6%, wahrend die VVT-Hubprofile durch die Vollentdrosselung die 10% erreichen. ; Im oberen TL-Bereich gibt es zwischen VVT- und SN-Hubprofilen kaum Unterschiede, da beide hier fur den entdrosselten Betrieb ausgelegt sind. Die Verbrennungsstabilitat liegt schon bei der Basisnocke auf hohem Niveau. Der Effekt der niedrigen Ladungswechsel- und Reibungsverluste auf den Kraftstoffverbrauch ist aufgrund der hoheren Last gering. Insgesamt betragt hier der erzielbare Verbrauchsvorteil ca. 6%.; Eine Potentialabschatzung im ganzen Abgastestbereich ergibt fur das Schaltnockensystem ohne Phasensteller eine Verbrauchseinsparung von ca. 7%, die bei dem VVT mit Phasensteller auf fast 10% ansteigen wurde. Die ersten Versuche auf dem Motorprufstand mit einer SN-Variante im transienten Betrieb bestatigen die Prognose aus den stationaren Messwerten.; Der Einsatz von Ventiltriebvariabilitaten in der Volllast wird ebenfalls evaluiert. Bei dem SN-System werden eine Drehmoment- und eine Leistungsnocke kombiniert. Dadurch ergibt sich ein sehr fulliger Drehmomentverlauf. Durch Verlangerung der Getriebeubersetzung kann somit ein Verbrauchsvorteil von ca. 2% erzielt werden. ; Beim VVT liegt die grose Herausforderung in der Volllast bei der mechanischen Festigkeit. Die Hubprofile sind flacher als bei starren Ventiltrieben und das maximale Drehmoment sinkt. ; Aufgrund seiner konstruktiven Eigenschaften wird das Schaltnockensystem ohne Einlassphasensteller als ein gunstiger Kompromiss bewertet, falls keine weiteren Anforderungen hinsichtlich Drehmoment und Leistung bestehen. Allerdings gilt es noch zu uberprufen, ob eine unauffallige Nockenumschaltung in der Teillast darstellbar ist. Der vollvariable Ventiltrieb bietet eine breitere Moglichkeit der Optimierung, aber die Drehzahlfestigkeit stellt eine grose Herausforderung dar. Die Notwendigkeit eines Einlassphasenstellers macht die Komplexitat eines derartigen Systems noch hoher. ; This work deals with the comparison of the potential for the fuel consumption reduction on motorcycle engines of two different variable valve train concepts: the fully variable valve actuation system (VVA) and the cam profile switching system (CS). With regard to the partial load operation within the exhaust emission test, two operating points with lower and higher load for steady state measurements are defined. To achieve unthrottled operation, lift profiles with early intake valve closing timing (EIVC) are used. The investigated valve lift profiles are obtained by shortening the opening duration (OD) of the reference intake cam profile while the maximal valve acceleration is maintained. ; The numerical results at lower load show that both short (approx. 40% of the reference OD) and middle (approx. 70% of the reference OD) valve lift profiles lead to unthrottled operation along with a dramatic reduction of the pumping losses. However, the calculated residual gas fraction varies greatly for the two cases, reaching a higher level for middle profiles. The simulation at higher load similarly shows a strong effect of unthrottled operation on the pumping losses. The residual gas fraction in this case remains almost unvaried. ; The combustion stability at low load is a big challenge for motorcycle engines due to their design characteristics. Furthermore, the EIVC strategy leads to a reduction of the turbulence within the combustion chamber and of the effective compression ratio as well. By means of 3D flow simulation several methods for improving the air motion are investigated. ; The experimental results at lower load confirm that valve lift profiles with short OD allow - in conjunction with unthrottled operation - a dramatic reduction of the pumping losses (VVA strategy). Valve lift profiles with middle OD cannot be run under unthrottled conditions, since the combustion stability is deteriorated by the low turbulence level in conjunction with the high residual gas fraction. However, such profiles can be used as CS variants without intake cam phaser in conjunction with a later IVO and throttled operation. That leads to a very stable combustion and thereby achieves an improvement in the fuel consumption compared to the reference cam.; The low friction losses resulting from the reduced valve lift have a further effect on the fuel consumption at lower load. In sum, the investigations show a reduction of the fuel consumption with the CS lift profiles of about 6%, whereas 10% should be achievable with the VVA lift profiles under unthrottled operation.; At higher load VVA and CS lift profiles are very similar, because the CS system was designed alike the VVA for unthrottled operation here. In this case, the combustion stability is already very high with the reference cam. The effect of the reduced pumping and friction losses on the fuel consumption is very slight due to the higher engine load. Altogether the amount of the fuel consumption reduction comes to approx. 6% here.; An evaluation of the potential in the exhaust test leads to a fuel consumption reduction of approx. 7% for the CS system without cam phaser. Due to the unthrottled operation, such a value would increase to almost 10% with the VVA. First results on the engine rig under transient conditions with a CS cam confirm the prediction based on the steady state measurements. ; Moreover, variable valve actuation can be used to increase the torque curve. On the CS system, i.e. a high-torque and a high-power cam profile can be combined. Such an approach is also investigated in this work and leads to a very generous torque curve. By using a longer gear ratio, a fuel consumption advantage of approx. 2% can be achieved. The big challenge under full load for the VVA is to achieve enough stiffness at motorcycle typical revs. The maximal valve acceleration is lower than on conventional valve trains and the achievable maximal torque drops.; Due to its mechanical layout, the CS system without intake cam phaser is considered to be a reasonable compromise when no further requests concerning torque and power exist. In a next step it should examined, whether a smooth cam switching under partial load operation in spite of the stiff driveline of motorcycle engines can be realized. The VVA offers more flexibility for the optimization but the required stiffness at high revs poses a major challenge. The necessity of an intake cam phaser makes such a system even more complex.",,,,,Analytical chemistry; Electrical engineering; Physics; Valve lift; Exhaust emission; Intake valve; Residual gas fraction; Low load; Design characteristics; Low friction; Gear ratio,,,,,http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/4533,http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/4533,,,1496640286,,0,,1

The first version of the actuator disc momentum theory is more than 100 years old. The extension towards very low rotational speeds with high torque for discs with a constant circulation, became available only recently. This theory gives the performance data like the power coefficient and average velocity at the disc. Potential flow calculations have added flow properties like the distribution of this velocity. The present paper addresses the comparison of actuator discs representing propellers and wind turbines, with emphasis on the velocity at the disc. At a low rotational speed, propeller discs have an expanding wake while still energy is put into the wake. The high angular momentum of the wake, due to the high torque, creates a pressure deficit which is supplemented by the pressure added by the disc thrust. This results in a positive energy balance while the wake axial velocity has lowered. In the propeller and wind turbine flow regime the velocity at the disc is 0 for a certain minimum but non-zero rotational speed. At the disc, the distribution of the axial velocity component is non-uniform in all flow states. However, the distribution of the velocity in the plane containing the axis, the meridian plane, is practically uniform (deviation approximately 0.2 %) for wind turbine disc flows with tip speed ratio λ > 5, almost uniform (deviation 2 %) for wind turbine disc flows with λ = 1 and propeller flows with advance ratio J = Π, and non-uniform (deviation 5 %) for the propeller disc flow with wake expansion at J = 2 Π. These differences in uniformity are caused by the different strengths of the singularity in the wake boundary vorticity strength at its leading edge.",5,3,855,865,Physics; Potential flow; Momentum theory; Tip-speed ratio; Turbine; Wake; Mechanics; Advance ratio; Propeller; Rotational speed,,,,,https://www.wind-energ-sci-discuss.net/wes-2020-51/ https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/5/855/2020/ https://www.wind-energ-sci-discuss.net/wes-2020-51/wes-2020-51.pdf https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atudelft.nl%3Auuid%3A41669d08-b874-430e-b81d-4fea734680fe https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/on-the-velocity-at-wind-turbine-and-propeller-actuator-discs https://wes.copernicus.org/preprints/wes-2020-51/wes-2020-51.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/wes-5-855-2020,,10.5194/wes-5-855-2020,3009518837,,0,000-783-841-085-269; 005-572-948-103-350; 011-805-501-193-996; 013-228-306-709-614; 025-418-531-514-621; 030-170-141-002-334; 038-914-732-918-467; 039-219-408-548-355; 040-334-780-429-634; 041-135-836-433-62X; 049-427-268-987-733; 056-661-999-634-738; 056-726-659-565-128; 058-181-852-035-60X; 075-042-875-940-924; 077-085-895-338-378; 081-698-678-844-529; 101-833-588-642-539; 123-154-494-028-785; 126-253-583-125-651; 133-025-974-501-545; 161-396-213-145-417; 161-919-025-744-324,1

The hybrid exoskeleton approach, demonstrated in a soft knee industrial exoskeleton case, mitigates the discomfort of wearers as it aims to avoid the drawbacks of rigid exoskeletons and textile-based soft exosuits. Quasi-direct drive actuation using high-torque density motors minimizes the weight of the device and presents high backdrivability that does not restrict natural movement. We derive a biomechanics model that is generic to both squat and stoop lifting motion. The control algorithm symbiotically detects posture using compact inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to generate an assistive profile that is proportional to the biological torque generated from our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot exhibits 1.5 Nm torque when it is unpowered and 0.5 Nm torque with zero-torque tracking control. The efficacy of injury prevention is demonstrated with one healthy subject. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking is less than 0.29 Nm (1.21% of 24 Nm peak torque) for 50% assistance of biological torque. Comparing to the squat without exoskeleton, the maximum amplitude of the knee extensor muscle activity (rectus femoris) measured by Electromyography (EMG) sensors is reduced by 30% with 50% assistance of biological torque.",,,,,Squatting position; Torque; Exoskeleton; Biomechanics; Electromyography; Squat; Computer science; Control theory; Inertial measurement unit; Robot,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1902.html#abs-1902-07106 https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07106 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07106,https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07106,,,2916611735,,0,000-106-910-658-705; 006-077-695-687-172; 008-589-158-200-885; 023-360-950-534-182; 028-862-609-405-071; 030-507-157-672-704; 034-120-902-544-673; 038-512-819-535-096; 038-721-557-967-796; 039-416-036-089-129; 043-335-472-372-203; 049-605-800-281-032; 052-718-154-842-091; 054-028-823-446-315; 056-353-641-915-733; 059-579-998-080-100; 060-359-253-947-452; 075-483-804-565-42X; 106-527-885-911-500; 107-096-910-931-285; 137-267-778-313-325; 142-620-654-763-338; 171-657-287-635-73X; 184-879-768-742-478,0

Kub,"Switched Reluctance Machines (SRMs) applied in compact adjustable speed drives are receiving during the last two decades considerable attention from industry since they are characterised by rigid construction, high operation reliability, high efficiency, high torque to inertia ratio and finally low manufacturing costs. The successful realization of a SRM drive demands inter alia of the determination of the best motor construction from the point of view of the requirements of considered drive. Design examples of two industrial SRMs made by factories are presented in this paper. These are prototypes of a high-speed 6/4-motor for an electric spindle drive for textile spinning machines and an 8/6-motor desired as a short-time actuator in an automatic truck gear. Laboratory tests were made for all SRM’s constructions. The comparison of both analytical calculation and experimental results are made.

Furthermore, the operational efficiency and quality of the high speed spindle are significantly influenced by the turbine blades and the bearings respectively. Through detailed configurational studies and performance analyses on diverse minitype turbine blades, we have derived the efficiency- and quality-influential parameters. And based on optimization results, we have developed a novel type of twin bladed air turbine (TB-air turbine), which consists of two parallel blades with an angular offset. The offseted twin blades can efficiently and smoothly transform pneumatic energy into rotational energy. Therefore, steady driving force and less dynamic unbalance are able to be easily achieved for reducing nervous disturbances such as vibration, noise, and wear. By applying finite element analytical method, the operational performances and quality of the new developed twin bladed air turbine such as rotational speed, torque, vibration and noise were analyzed for comprehending influences of the design parameters and the operational parameters. While the inlet angle, the blade shape and its geometric parameters are the dominant design parameters; the inlet pressure and mass flow rate, and the outlet pressure are the main operational parameters. Through the turbine blades, the pneumatic energy will be transformed into operational energy in form of the flow field and the pressure distribution and the energy loss in form of turbulence. Also by integrating knowledge of production technology, a neat design of the turbine blades suitable for automatic manufacturing process is developed. And furthermore, through an elaborate layout of the flow guiding, a minimum rotational runout can be effectively achieved without any complicate and costly dynamic balancing process. Consequently, it has significantly depressed the stream noise and raised the operation lifetime of bearings. According to our experimental verification, the vibration and the stream noise of our TB-air turbines are 60% and 50% lower than traditional counterparts respectively. Our developed minitype spindle with novel TB-air turbine can efficiently realize high speed rotation with high torque, less vibration and less noise.Copyright © 2009 by ASME",,,175,181,Bearing (mechanical); Engineering; Torque; Vibration; Turbine blade; Turbine; Machining; Ram air turbine; Mechanical engineering; Rotational speed,,,,,https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1647233 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings/GT2009/48869/175/344222 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1647233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/gt2009-59702,,10.1115/gt2009-59702,1993518561,,0,,1

A lightweight, compliant and user-specific actuator is critical for maximizing the benefits of an exoskeleton to users. To date, pediatric exoskeletons generally use the same actuators as adult exoskeletons, which are heavy and resistive to natural movement. There is yet no easy way for robotic exoskeletons to accommodate the changes in design requirements that occur as a child ages. We developed a lightweight (1.65 kg unilateral mass) and compliant pediatric knee exoskeleton with a bandwidth of 22.6 Hz that can provide torque assistance to children with crouch gait using high torque density motor. Experimental results demonstrated that the robot exhibited low mechanical impedance (1.79 Nm average backdrive torque) under the unpowered condition and 0.32 Nm with zero-torque tracking control. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking result is less than 0.73 Nm (5.7% with respect to 12 Nm torque). To achieve optimal age-specific performance, we proposed the first optimization framework that considered both motor and transmission of the actuator system that can produce optimal settings for children between 3 and 18 years old. The optimization generated an optimal motor air gap radius that monotonically increases with age from 0.011 to 0.033 meters, and optimal gear ratio varies from 2.6 to 11.6 (3-13 years old) and 11.6 to 10.2 (13-18 years old), leading to actuators of minimal mass.",,,,,Torque; Exoskeleton; Mechanical impedance; Actuator; Backdrive; Computer science; Simulation; Air gap (plumbing); Resistive touchscreen; Robot,,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00289.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00289,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00289.pdf,,,3118491601,,0,001-479-440-309-735; 008-589-158-200-885; 008-952-415-424-251; 009-387-121-815-975; 009-448-906-375-486; 013-337-388-490-881; 016-448-585-089-326; 019-656-453-683-10X; 023-844-490-529-315; 030-499-013-307-524; 034-863-184-024-012; 036-680-226-056-372; 038-638-526-103-314; 050-203-314-686-177; 051-186-033-077-142; 051-245-906-999-988; 052-918-621-536-795; 054-082-703-364-38X; 059-579-998-080-100; 078-722-642-190-032; 083-886-229-535-65X; 103-559-621-987-402; 104-075-675-651-256; 107-171-765-482-280; 108-604-752-332-600; 112-701-015-178-315; 148-117-840-386-281,0

Rebbapragada; R.H. Daugherty; A.E. Richards; J.D. Kueck,"A status report on an effort of the Working Group IEEE-NPEC-SC4.7 is presented and the performance requirements, selection, design, and protection of valve actuator motors (VAMs) commonly used as components in direct gear driven valve actuator assemblies in nuclear power plants are discussed. VAMs are short-time-rated, high torque-to-inertial ratio motors. The actuator manufacturer selects the performance parameters for the VAM based on the maximum thrust required by the valve for tight shutoff. Since valve actuators require a high starting torque, the rating system begins with the assignment of nominal starting torque. The requirement of minimum frame size dictates a minimal (running) torque and a minimum run time. Design features of the VAM leading up to its design as a short-time-duty rated motor are described and compared with a continuous-duty motor designed to NEMA MG1. The unique features of the speed-torque characteristics and performance at varying voltages and temperatures are described. >",5,3,572,584,Rotary actuator; Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Valve actuator; Electric motor; Control valves; Overcurrent; Thrust,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel3/60/3229/00105284.pdf?arnumber=105284 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ITEnC...5..572R/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/60.105284,,10.1109/60.105284,2100294356,,0,007-533-237-437-574; 025-867-592-745-849; 049-343-570-987-71X; 053-437-943-977-103; 168-912-468-076-399; 173-987-632-732-229; 175-480-537-866-755,6

Exoskeleton type devices are now being developed to isolate the motion of individual joints. These devices tend to have higher complexity and reduced range of motion as compared to endpoint manipulators, but they target more selectively the desired joint(s), and they enable more precise data collection about the motion of the patient's limb. Recent designs have focused on systems that match the full range of motion of the targeted joints, aiming towards actuated systems that have both high torque output, to assist patients with muscle tone, and low intrinsic impedance, to minimally perturb independent arm movements.

Spyker; E. Ruckstadter,"Switched reluctance motors are being considered as possible candidates for electromechanical (EMA) and electrohydraulic (EHA) actuators in the Air Force's More Electric Aircraft (MEA). A motor of this kind is particularly suited to EHA and EMA applications due to its inherent simplicity, its ruggedness, high speed capabilities, and its inherent fault tolerance. For actuator applications a machine should be expected to turn at 15,000 RPM and develop 120 in-lbs of torque. It will also be required to maintain a high repetition rate of high torque starts, and operate at elevated temperatures. A four pole axially laminated anisotropic (ALA) rotor has been designed that takes advantage of magnetic anisotropy in the rotor lamination material. 3.25% grain oriented silicon steel was used to optimize the change in inductance from the unaligned to the aligned rotor position.

The introduction of intrinsic compliance can help to meet both these requirements.

This paper presents a rotary Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), suitable to be used in an active orthosis for knee assistance during overground walking. The system includes a commercial flat brushless DC motor, a Harmonic Drive gear and a custom-designed torsion spring. Spring design has been optimized by means of an iterative FEM simulations-based process and can be directly connected to the output shaft, thus guaranteeing high torque fidelity. With a total weight of 1.8 kg, it is possible to directly include the actuator in the frame of a wearable orthosis for knee flexion/extension assistance.

To develop multi-DOF wrist mechanisms that can emulate human wrists, compactness and high torque density are the major challenges. Traditional approaches use a series of rotary motors that require gearing to amplify the output torque. This often results in an oversized wrist. Alternatively, large linear force can be easily attained in a compact space by using leadscrew motors. Inspired by the muscle–tendon actuation pattern, the proposed mechanism consists of two parallel placed linear motors. Their translational motions are transmitted to two perpendicular axes of rotation through a spherical mechanism and two slider crank mechanisms. A high torque density can be achieved. Static and dynamic models are developed to design and analyze the wrist mechanism. Experiments of a wrist prototype are presented and the results are discussed. The novel mechanism is lightweight and has a humanlike appearance.

In this paper, the open-loop behavior of a GBD prototype is experimentally characterized to obtain a dynamic model for its velocity/position response. Two analytical models for the transmission stiffness are developed using the bending flexure of gear-teeth and transmission geometry that accurately capture the stiffness characteristics. Finally, a sensitivity study is presented that reproduces the response of this transmission under various input and output loads. Analysis of the system dynamics suggests that the GBD behavior is dominated by linear dynamics that are characterized by finite friction dissipation and geometric errors in its gear mesh resulting from imperfect manufacturing.

Yildirim; Tarik Uzunovic; Emre Sariyildiz,"Compared to the traditional industrial robots that use rigid actuators, the advanced robotic systems are mobile and physically interact with unknown and dynamic environments. Therefore, they need intrinsically safe and compact actuators. In the last two decades, Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) have been one of the most popular compliant actuators in advanced robotic applications due to their intrinsically safe and compact mechanical structures. The mobility and functionality of the advanced robotic systems are highly related to the torque-density of their actuators. For example, the amount of assistance an exoskeleton robot can provide is determined by the trade-off between the weight and output-torque, i.e., torque-density, of its actuators. As the torque outputs of the actuators are increased, the exoskeleton can expand its capacity yet it generally becomes heavier and bulkier. This has significant impact on the mobility of the advanced robotic systems. Therefore, it is essential to design light-weight actuators which can provide high-output torque. However, this still remains a big challenge in engineering. To this end, this paper proposes a high-torque density SEA for physical robot environment interaction (p-REI) applications. The continuous (peak) output-torque of the proposed compliant actuator is 147Nm (467 Nm) and its weight is less than 2.5kg. It is shown that the weight can be lessened to 1.74, but it comes at cost. The performance of the proposed compliant actuator is experimentally verified.",,,235,240,Control engineering; Torque; Human–robot interaction; Motion control; Exoskeleton; Actuator; Rehabilitation robotics; Torque density; Computer science; Robot,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu,https://doi.org/10.1109/AMC44022.2020.9244330,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/amc44022.2020.9244330,,10.1109/amc44022.2020.9244330,3101820272,,0,001-349-141-647-448; 001-501-694-057-716; 004-012-206-536-008; 014-201-199-762-01X; 031-733-234-427-123; 033-036-449-689-533; 042-424-203-250-257; 046-801-352-504-800; 065-858-474-261-68X; 076-541-775-909-869; 076-708-624-293-43X; 080-432-712-557-108; 089-268-494-782-846; 110-782-610-483-212; 111-935-217-527-451; 123-967-760-609-733; 125-262-632-160-671; 128-269-476-741-247; 129-577-756-406-970; 150-749-445-232-589; 172-358-949-317-965,0

The parallel mechanism introduced in this paper has the advantage of mechanical and kinematic simplicity when compared to existing platforms while at the same time it is fully capable of carrying out all the exercises required by ankle rehabilitation protocols. The proposed device makes use of actuation redundancy to eliminate singularity and greatly improve the workspace dexterity. In addition, the requirements for high torque capacity and back-drivability are satisfied with the employment of a custom made cable driven linear electric actuator that combines the high force capacity with excellent back-drivability.

Dorrell; Leila Parsa; Ion Boldea,"Due to environmental and energy concerns, electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid EVs (HEVs) are gaining increased attention. At the heart of the drive system of these vehicles is the electric machine and drive. For these applications, high power density, high torque density, wide speed range, and efficiency are of primary importance. To meet these demands, interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) machines have been widely used. However, IPM machines use rare-earth PMs (usually neodymium-iron-boron magnets) in their structure. The price of these types of rare-earth PMs has increased by orders of magnitude over several years. Due to the high cost and limited supply of this material, the use of IPM machines in HEV applications is now being challenged. In fact, many researchers are working on other machines that can compete with IPM machines in terms of size, efficiency, power, and torque density. With consideration of the above points, there is a timeliness to this important topic; thus, we are pleased to present this ""Special Section on Automotive Electric Motors, Generators, and Actuator Drive Systems With Reduced or No Permanent Magnets and Innovative Design Concepts"" of the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics that consists of 12 papers reporting on the most recent research on automotive electric drive machines.

This is the first US lander of its kind, since it is unguided and airbag-protected for hard landing using airbags, instead of retro rockets, to soft land. The arrival condition, location, and orientation of the Lander will only be known by the computer on the Lander. The Lander will then autonomously perform the appropriate sequence to retract the airbags, right itself, and open, such that the Lander is nearly level with no airbag material covering the solar cells. This function uses two different types of mechanisms - the Airbag Retraction Actuators and the Lander Petal Actuators - which are designed for the high torque, low temperature, dirty environment and for limited life application. The development of these actuators involved investigating low temperature lubrication, Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) to cut gears, and gear design for limited life use.",,,,,Software deployment; Engineering; Aerospace engineering; Retrorocket; Actuator; Airbag; Dirty environment; High torque; Mars pathfinder; Mars landing,,,,,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19960025613 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/518808,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19960025613,,,781682384,,0,,2

Extensive studies have been performed in the area of vertical motion in order to dissipate the forces from an impact whereas the study on longitudinal motion has not been so comprehensive.; The aim of this thesis is to present an analysis of how torque modulation can be used to mitigate the longitudinal vibrations felt by the passengers in the vehicle when it is subjected to impacts through speed lowering obstacles.; A study is performed to understand how road disturbances are inducing longitudinal vibrations and forces in the wheel assembly. The typical behaviour of the system is analysed in order to come up with a solution on the problem. The study has mainly been performed in a simulation environment using Simpack as MBS software and the vehicle model has been validated through proving ground tests.; In order to enable torque modulation when the vehicle is subjected to an impact, a hypothetical controller is created in Simulink and co-simulated with Simpack.; The results show improvement in lowering the high seat rail acceleration peaks of impact harshness although there is room for improvement regarding the controller to make it more stable and robust.; ; A very high torque is requested by the controller however further investigation shows that the torque can be limited to 250 Nm without significantly affecting the improvement of the vibrations caused by the impact. This gives a more realistic torque demand and flexibility in choosing actuators.",,,,,Acceleration; Engineering; Torque; Vehicle engineering; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Vibration; Harshness; Vehicle dynamics; Control theory,,,,,https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/211567 http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/211567/211567.pdf https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstream/20.500.12380/211567/1/211567.pdf,https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/211567,,,267821903,,0,003-307-192-138-800; 024-468-366-538-257; 084-568-193-641-436,0

While DC motor consumes a lot of power and limits the working time of the exoskeleton, it produces large impedance that would cause discomfort and danger to people. Magnetorheological (MR) fluid is a smart fluid that can change its rheological behavior under applied magnetic field. Devices using MR fluids have the benefits of high torque, good controllability, low power requirement, and safety. In this research, we develop a new MR actuator for leg exoskeleton. The MR actuator consists of a DC motor and an MR brake/clutch. When active torque is desired, the DC motor works and the MR actuator functions as a clutch to transfer the torque generated by the motor to the leg; when passive torque is desired, the DC motor is turned off and the MR actuator functions as a brake to provide controllable passive torque.

Steyn,"Abstract A novel implementation of a dual-wheel actuator is presented for a spacecraft with high agility requirements, e.g. where the imaging payload is strapped to the satellite body and the bore sight has to be shifted from one target location to another by slewing the complete satellite in minimum-time. To maximise the torque capability, the actuator can be utilised as a “scissored” type control moment gyro (CMG-mode) with parallel gimbals. A system with 2 single-gimbal CMGs per body axis, can simplify the gimbal steering method with gimbal angle constraints and avoid any control torque singularities prevalent in other CMG configurations. During fine pointing maneuvers the dual-wheel actuator can be used in reaction wheel mode (RW-mode). In this way the unique advantages of both CMG and reaction wheel actuators can be exploited, while the transition between either modes can be done smoothly. In CMG-mode the torque capability can be at least one order of magnitude greater and the peak electrical power requirement will be much lower during the CMG high torque phases of a maneuver, compared to the RW-mode. In RW-mode the torque resolution and wheel induced disturbances can be more conducive for the high stability requirement of an imaging payload. The dual-wheel units can be aligned and parked into two orthogonal axes during reaction wheel use, resulting in multiple redundancy, i.e. any two wheels may fail, while still maintaining full 3-axis control authority. The paper will present the torque, angular momentum and gimbal steering equations for the dual-wheel actuator. Next, a near-minimum-time eigenaxis slew maneuver algorithm is derived for the CMG-mode, where optimal agility is required. Finally, the paper concludes with a simulation of a practical satellite application. The performance of a near-minimum-time eigenaxis slew maneuver in CMG-mode is compared to the results obtained when the maneuver is executed using a pyramid array of four single-gimbal CMGs with similar performance constraints and driven by time optimised, singularity robust steering logic.",12,7,545,554,Gimbal; Engineering; Control moment gyroscope; Torque; Attitude control; Gyroscope; Actuator; Reaction wheel; Simulation; Control theory; Torque steering,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963808000217 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1270963808000217#!,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2008.01.003,,10.1016/j.ast.2008.01.003,1986515921,,3,005-694-066-701-880; 005-787-736-667-478; 020-481-023-862-216; 029-070-723-240-742; 031-872-522-469-66X; 032-597-804-638-559; 045-986-138-265-068; 047-425-178-468-591; 049-396-177-317-620; 051-933-254-405-839; 055-764-065-388-786; 075-921-442-259-309; 077-117-858-931-619; 102-642-906-489-125; 114-026-035-908-721,12

Hammond; Kenji Shimada,"As manufacturing companies endeavor to design more versatile, energy-efficient, and productive assembly lines, the design and employment of kinematically redundant robotic manipulators has become an increasingly important research focus. Redundant manipulators can perform more complex and a greater variety of tasks than their non-redundant counterparts, but this increased utility demands that manipulators be carefully designed to achieve the kinematic fitness level required to perform their numerous intended tasks. The optimization of redundant manipulators to maximize design fitness measures such as motion isotropy has been studied at great length, but much of the previous work focuses solely on kinematic considerations such as end-effector velocity and precision, which are adequate measures for light-duty, low-energy tasks. Optimizing manipulators for heavy-duty tasks, however, demands the incorporation of dynamics into these isotropy measures to ensure that large manipulator payloads and accelerations can be handled without damaging actuators or consuming exorbitant amounts of energy. In this paper we investigate the incorporation of dynamic torque limitations into the calculation of kinematic isotropy. We will use a torque-weighted isotropy measure as a fitness metric for redundant manipulators performing tasks that require high torque and energy consumption. We will employ this metric as a multiobjective cost function for both morphological design and manipulator placement optimization problems. The effectiveness of the torque-weighted isotropy in design optimization is demonstrated by decreasing total energy consumption and maintaining adequate global isotropy for heavy-duty manufacturing tasks.",,,1,8,Engineering; Control engineering; Optimization problem; Torque; Payload; Actuator; Isotropy; Energy consumption; Kinematics; Control theory; Robot end effector,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005174707 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icar/icar2009.html#HammondS09,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005174707,,,2151144179,,0,011-031-014-012-952; 036-265-066-848-312; 038-166-086-542-07X; 040-436-487-001-337; 043-921-596-218-154; 050-067-841-626-586; 053-909-278-933-153; 058-692-099-736-231; 059-735-528-837-190; 066-093-538-238-249; 069-833-666-305-557; 070-138-899-966-453; 082-289-761-125-663; 084-641-826-330-987; 094-020-742-218-18X; 095-793-916-494-100; 097-566-793-806-815; 099-366-854-265-298; 102-595-602-497-610; 130-009-687-364-673; 185-284-743-714-79X,3

Hawkes; Robert J. Wood,"This paper presents low-profile torsional actuators applicable for mesoscale and microscale robots. The primary actuator material is thermally activated Ni–Ti shape memory alloy (SMA), which exhibits remarkably high torque density. Despite the advantages of SMAs for actuator applications—high strain, silent operation, and mechanical simplicity—the response time and energy efficiency limit overall performance. As an alternative to SMA wires, thin SMA sheets are used to fabricate effective yet compact torsional actuators. Also, instead of using conventional Joule heating, an external Ni–Cr heating element is utilized to focus heat on the regions of highest required strain. Various design parameters and fabrication variants are described and experimentally explored in actuator prototypes.

Bourbon; Hiroyuki Fujita; Takahisa Masuzawa,"This paper investigates new design rules that will allow the development of high torque electrostatic micromotor through the cooperation of arrayed direct drive actuators. Electrostatic scratch drive actuators, which combine active frictional contact mechanisms with the electrostatic actuation are particularly analyzed because previous achievement shave pointed their ability to develop, at a low speed, high driving forces comparatively to their little size. Scratch drive actuators (SDA) have been already successfully applied, as an example for self assembling microstructures and micro optical bench actuation. Such interesting results which have been performed by using an individual or a few numbers of SDA, led us to make further investigations in order to optimize this new promising actuator technology. Consequently, we have mainly focused on new mechanisms which integrate combinations of a large number of SDA, in such a way to allow powerful annular and tubular micromotors to be designed, machined, and then characterized. This paper points our the main physical and technological principles that will allow high torque electrostatic micromotors to be realized in a near future. It also gives the first results that have been obtained on the design and surface-micromachining of annular and tubular micromotors. The previous result related to the batch fabrication of large and thin polysilicon sheets, which integrate up to several thousands of microactuators are also given. New concepts which will allow large size and high torque 3D electrostatic micromotors to be realized through the forming of thin polysilicon sheets, are finally described. The expected driving characteristics show the interest of both cooperative arrayed microactuators and direct drive frictional mechanisms.© (1997) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

This paper presents a device capable of reducing the load experienced by the impaired knee. Its series elastic actuator was modeled to aid in the selection of the elastic stiffness (150 kN/m) and test the controller which displayed adequate tracking performance with a maximum provided torque of about 6 Nm.

In order to realize some visual performances by complicated eye movements, like tracking target, image stabilization and vestibulo-ocular reflex, we present the mechanism and simulation of a robot bionic eye based on spherical ultrasonic motor (SUSM) with three rotational degrees of freedom (3-DOF). SUSM is a compact mechanism occupying little space but good responsiveness, high positioning accuracy, high torque at low speed and strong magnetic field compatibility. So based on SUSM, the bionic eye is fit to solve the problem of vision instability during robots' working. The bionic eye is constructed of three annular stators adhered with several piezoelectric elements and a spherical rotor as a camera actuator. The rotor is driven by frictional forces from the three stators accompanying with same preload generated by the deformations of specialized coil springs. Through simulation by a virtual prototype to analyze the rotational speed, torque and responsiveness, our mechanical design is verified to be reasonable and effective preliminary.",,,348,356,Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Torque; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Acoustics; Image stabilization; Simulation; Machine vision; Rotational speed; Robot,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icira/icira2012-1.html#LuoHLXZ12 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33509-9_34 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33509-9_34,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33509-9_34,,10.1007/978-3-642-33509-9_34,2179061649,,2,016-649-507-403-632; 020-141-365-366-094; 025-187-205-817-12X; 030-031-965-672-162; 034-285-301-507-469; 086-938-974-715-74X; 090-336-504-931-807; 094-618-535-710-370; 095-704-761-944-164; 097-520-920-685-355; 111-082-078-406-374; 164-154-666-111-364,0

However, it is difficult for automobiles to run under such economical conditions because acceleration is frequently required. Therefore, if an automobile engine is operated by consolidated control with continuously variable transmission (CVT), the minimum fuel consumption will be achieved, satisfying the driver's demand for a particular vehicle speed. The advantage of this consolidated control for fuel economy depends on several factors, such as specifications of the automobile, the performance of controllers, the driving mode of the automobile and the performance of the control actuators. In this report, the required CVT's operating speed which involves the performance of the actuators was investigated by simulation studies as well as theoretical analysis.",58,555,3495,3500,Acceleration; Torque; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Continuously variable transmission; Operating speed; Driving mode; Computer science; Fuel efficiency; Automotive engine,,,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kikaib1979/58/555/58_555_3495/_pdf http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/kikaib1979/58.3495?from=CrossRef,http://dx.doi.org/10.1299/kikaib.58.3495,,10.1299/kikaib.58.3495,2333613179,,0,,0

The corresponding power ratings of such machines ranges now from fractions of Watts to some million of Watts, as in a wind generator.; ; Actually, among the electrical machines, the PM synchronous machine is the more deeply studied from academia and industry. In particular, the PM synchronous machine combines several advantages as high effciency, high power factor, high torque density, high overload capability, robustness, reduced maintenance, compactness and low weight.; ; These advantages are becoming crucial for those non-industrial application, as the electric vehicles. High performance and compactness are often the winning characteristics of such machines as respect to the induction machines. Referring to the automotive eld, variable speed drives as PM synchronous machine are adopted to improve the overall performance of the vehicles. ; ; The design exibility due to the absence of rotor winding excitation and the variety of PM sizes and characteristics allow to achieve several features, e.g. fault-tolerance ; and fux-weakening capability. Thanks to these features the PM machine is a suitable candidate for traction requirements.; ; However the recent trend is to select those congurations that allow to minimize the PM utilization. It is also due to the issues related to PM temperature derating, mechanical stress, and PM reliability. The PM synchronous reluctance machine or interior PM machine is, among the others, a promising candidate to satisfy the traction requirements. Thanks to its anisotropy; rotor structure is able to provide torque not only due to the PM ; ux. In addition the adoption of fractional-slot winding, as respect to the standard integral-slot winding, is imperative to achieve some of the appealing features. ; ; In this field, several topics are under study by the international community of researchers. However, the aim of the doctoral work is to deepen some aspects concerning the design of these machines. It is worth noticing that the complexity of the rotor structure of these machine involves several drawbacks, such as torque oscillations, additional iron losses, vibrations, and so on. Therefore, some aspects have been analyzed by means of analytical procedures, nite element simulations and experiential measurements on prototypes. ; ; The variety of topic treated is directly due to the complexity of the design: a tradeo between advantages and drawbacks is usually necessary rather than a perfect minimization of a single aspect. Therefore, an overview of the design options is required; in order to design a suitable machine. ; ; In the contest of the analysis of the interior permanent magnet machines, the objectives can be summarized as:; 1) To evaluate how the rotor geometry aects the torque ripple, and thus the solutions allowing to minimize it.; ; 2) To evaluate how the rotor geometry aects the eddy current iron losses in the stator teeth, and thus the solutions allowing to minimize it (in particular referring to the fux-weakening operating conditions).; ; 3) To deeply investigate the torque mechanism and complex magnetic phenomena, in particular adopting fractional-slot winding. ; ; 4) To investigate a particular conguration of fault-tolerant machine, the dual three-phase machine provided of a suitable anisotropic rotor.; ; ; To the knowledge of the author, the remarkable contribution of this thesis for future researchers in this eld are:; 1) An analytical model of the anisotropic synchronous machine that can be simply adopted to evaluate optimal solutions allowing to satisfy selected objectives. It has been applied to the issues of torque ripple minimization and stator tooth eddy; current minimization. The model has been veried experimentally comparing the measured and predicted stator tooth flux density.; ; 2) An extended analysis of the dual three-phase machine provided of an interior permanent magnet rotor, supported by experimental verication. A simple design rule to select the appropriate number of slots and poles in order to achieve a six-; phase machine is proposed.",,,,,Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Rotor (electric); Magnetic reluctance; Stator; Torque ripple; Power factor; Derating; Synchronous motor,,,,,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/3497/,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/3497/,,,2281122289,,0,,16

Studies toward the integration of such actuators in complex micromechatronic systems require the size reduction of these actuators while retaining a wide range of performances. Two main fabrication processes are currently used for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators, providing very different behaviors: (i) the use of a bulk layers and (ii) the use of thin film growth. In this study, we propose to develop micropositioning actuators and platform whose performances are a trade-off between the performances from these two technologies. The proposed trade-off technology allows the development of microsystems with high stiffness, high torque and high dynamics (from technology (i)), as well as, large motion, low voltage and small size (from technology (ii)). Using this technology we designed and fabricated a thick film PZT platform containing eight unimorph beam bending actuators. The Platform allows a high level of performances, both in the static (displacement) and dynamic (first resonance frequency) regimes. The purpose of the fabricated platform is to improve the micromanipulation and microassembly processes, to the point where approaching and manipulating very small object with a high precision will be a very fast and simple operation. These devices were obtained through a room temperature mechanical thinning of a PZT thick layers, after the deposition of Nickel on the bottom side. The piezoelectric beam bending actuators have a 80 μm thick PZT layer on top of a 10 μm thick Nickel layer, a length of 5 mm and a width of 0.5 mm. Experimental characterization has shown that the static displacements obtained are in excess of 1.33 μm/V and the resonance frequencies are up to 1814 Hz, which are very convenient in high dynamics micropositioning applications such as microrobotics and microassembly tasks.",197,,53,60,Resonance; Low voltage; Fabrication; Microsystem; Actuator; Thin film; Materials science; Unimorph; Mechanical engineering; Bending,,,,ANR; French RENATECH network; FEMTO-ST technological facility; Labex ACTION,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167931718302107#! https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167931718302107,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mee.2018.05.007,,10.1016/j.mee.2018.05.007,2807465797,,0,001-406-686-285-879; 001-563-398-683-61X; 005-083-675-718-597; 005-708-927-675-43X; 011-048-349-733-760; 012-485-381-645-295; 023-800-620-051-598; 025-682-237-811-345; 028-702-063-483-998; 036-786-449-180-528; 038-606-656-572-26X; 046-101-821-849-581; 049-600-735-063-14X; 049-803-090-111-510; 050-629-482-946-714; 054-936-111-626-32X; 059-108-041-193-343; 072-324-025-303-722; 075-467-340-058-314; 076-218-349-531-365; 088-058-039-906-884; 103-196-953-527-12X; 113-507-747-114-226; 115-429-946-669-103; 118-203-178-512-29X; 122-246-837-442-868; 123-693-804-014-665; 124-796-571-679-188; 126-449-642-482-072; 167-051-438-506-986; 175-503-294-839-005; 196-762-488-997-851,6

Romo-Estrada; Brittany Newell; Jose Garcia,"An electroactive polymer is a material capable of changing its size and shape when an electric field is present. It is composed of a thin film of dielectric elastomer and two electrodes placed on the top and bottom of the dielectric material. Since the rediscovery of their capabilities, electroactive polymers have been proposed as novel materials for use in numerous fields such as in bioengineering, electronics, hydraulics, and aerospace. It has been demonstrated that the actuation potential of electroactive polymer dielastomers can be significantly enhanced by mechanically pre-straining the material prior to application of an electric field. Application of uniform pre-strain is critical for uniform actuation and is challenging to achieve. This research details methods for constructing an automated uniform stretcher that resulted in the production of a LabView controlled iris stretcher for flexible materials. The high torque stretcher was capable of pre-straining materials with a minimum diameter of 1 inch mm) to a maximum diameter of 16 inches. The stretcher calculates the percent strain and has adjustable speed control through a high torque micro-stepper motor and controller. The stretcher’s capabilities were demonstrated on materials within varying tensile strengths up to 725 psi.Copyright © 2018 by ASME",,,,,Dielectric; Conductive polymer; Torque; Composite material; Electroactive polymers; Thin film; Materials science; Elastomer; Electronic speed control; Electric field,,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings/SMASIS2018/51951/V002T02A002/278343 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2715985 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2715985 https://risk.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/SMASIS/proceedings/SMASIS2018/51951/V002T02A002/278343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/smasis2018-7964,,10.1115/smasis2018-7964,2901034841,,0,,1

Pandey; K. Kaneto,"Abstract A new type of bending actuation, attained for folding and unfolding of a film, has been successfully demonstrated by patterning technique. The films exhibiting such behaviors were fabricated by the three steps of successive electrodeposition of PPy layers with masking technique. This has resulted into a film having the patchwork quilt form, constituted with two types of bi-ionic bending units [W. Takashima, S.S. Pandey, K. Kaneto, Sens. Actuators B 89 (2003) 48–52]. Cyclic electrochemical stimulation on the film, having a stripe shape pattern, successfully induced the reversible folding and unfolding deformations in the oxidized and the reduced states, respectively. Thus, such a film exhibiting its performance like a linear actuator can be visualized as an electrochemically active spring. The total length of the spring was found to change reversibly from 100% in maximum (unfolded) to 40% in minimum (folded) states, indicating to possess an extra-large strain of 60%. The stripe-pitch dependence on bending performance elucidates that the small pitch facilitates the bending performance because of high torque as well as effective bending. The results can be expressed as the enhancement of load-lifting performance by structural optimization for effective collection of the torque to a desired direction.",110,1,120,124,Conductive polymer; Torque; Masking (art); Linear actuator; Composite material; Nanotechnology; Actuator; Materials science; Ionic bonding; Electrochemistry; Bending,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400505001097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2005.01.018,,10.1016/j.snb.2005.01.018,2080575020,,1,000-485-996-196-857; 013-212-808-345-076; 013-298-916-063-607; 015-872-099-357-328; 020-233-678-838-951; 024-891-322-519-546; 028-065-410-444-549; 034-350-190-491-377; 058-340-501-469-508; 058-713-942-400-45X; 069-662-242-900-201; 074-058-021-730-149; 085-606-934-941-665; 087-159-895-905-530; 096-840-899-432-607; 097-162-870-873-261; 099-803-473-676-790; 158-022-882-693-926; 164-616-557-008-863; 167-206-046-854-491,11

The goal of this study is to determine if hydraulic disk brakes are suitable to actuate an upper-extremity exoskeleton, for application in rehabilitation settings. Passive actuation with friction brakes has direct implications for joint control. Braking is always opposite to the movement direction. During standstill, the measured torque is equal to the torque applied by the human. During rotations, it is equal to the brake torque. Actively assisting movement is not possible, nor are energy-requiring virtual environments. The evaluated disk brake has a 20 Nm bandwidth (flat-spectrum, multi-sine) of 10 Hz; sufficient for torques required for conventional therapy and simple, passive virtual environments. The maximum static output torque is 120 Nm, sufficient for isometric training of the upper extremity. The minimal impedance is close zero, with only the inertia of the device felt.

No.04CH37566),,IEEE,,Yuhei Yamaguchi; Junji Furusho; Shin'ya Kimura; Ken'ichi Koyanagi,"A force display system is a kind of human-coexistent robot systems, which share the space with people while they are working, and which directly touch and display force-senses to their users. For such a robot system, it is important to estimate safety quantitatively and to ensure mechanical safety. In this paper, it is described that using MR (magneto-rheological) actuators, which is one clutch type actuators, can ensure safety. Moreover, the characteristics of MR actuators that are low inertia, high torque/inertia ratio and high responsibility contribute to improve the performance of force display systems. In this study, we developed an MR actuator with low inertia (2.6/spl times/10/sup -5/[kg/spl middot/ m/sup 2/]), high torque/inertia ratio (3.8/spl times/10/sup 5/[1/s/sup 2/]) and high responsibility. Torque/inertia ratio of this MR actuator is highest among MR actuators developed so far and much higher than those of conventional servo actuators. Then, a high-performance 2-D force display system using the MR actuator was developed. Maximum force displayed is 190 [N] and rigidity of the system is 5.9 [N/mm]. Moreover, backdrivability, dynamic range and collision sense are improved by using MR actuators in comparison with a system using ER actuators.",3,,2911,2917,Servo; Inertia; Engineering; Torque; Display device; Actuator; Rigidity (psychology); Clutch; Simulation; Control theory; Dynamic range,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iros/iros2004.html#YamaguchiFKK04 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1389851/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iros.2004.1389851,,10.1109/iros.2004.1389851,1540189740,,1,001-547-237-980-189; 030-471-982-892-57X; 033-927-853-470-073; 046-141-380-556-295; 053-956-268-678-402; 063-551-301-166-327; 152-220-527-534-508; 179-973-821-358-96X; 183-680-604-755-657; 184-226-218-411-369,10

Mazzuca; G. Scala,"In today's large ships a wide use is made of hydrostatic transmission systems combined with traditional hydraulic machinery, such as piston-, rotary-vane- and screw-motors and pumps, to operate high-torque low-speed onboard actuators like rudders, stabilizing fins and bow thrusters. Such mechanical drives are very cumbersome and suffer from serious maintenance and reliability issues. In this paper, a novel all-electric direct-drive oil-free drive solution is proposed based on an inverter-fed permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM). The PMLSM is coupled to shipboard rotary equipment through an innovative kinematic chain, consisting of a tiller and a prismatic-rotoidal joint, that performs force to torque conversion. The advantages of the PMLSM solution are presented in the paper in terms of compactness, robustness, reliability, efficiency and maintenance.

The feature of the proposed knee othosis is to drive a knee joint with independent actuation during swing and stance phases, which can allow an actuator with fast rotation to control swing motions and an actuator with high torque to control stance motions, respectively. The quadriceps device operates in five-bar links with 2-DOF motions during swing phase and is changed to six-bar links during stance phase by the contact motion to the patella device. The hamstring device operates in a slider-crank mechanism for entire gait cycle. The suggested kinematic model will allow a robotic knee orthosis to use compact and light actuators with full support during walking. However, the proposed orthosis must use additional linkages than a simple four-bar mechanism. To maximize the benefit of reducing the actuators power by using the developed kinematic design, it is necessary to minimize total weight of the device, while keeping necessary actuator performances of torques and angular velocities for support. In this paper, we use a SGA (Simple Genetic Algorithm) to minimize sum of total link lengths and motor power by reducing the weight of the novel knee orthosis. To find feasible parameters, kinematic constraints of the hamstring and quadriceps mechanisms have been applied to the algorithm. The proposed optimization scheme could reduce sum of total link lengths to half of the initial value. The proposed optimization scheme can be applied to reduce total weight of general multi-linkages while keeping necessary actuator specifications.",17,10,1021,1028,Engineering; Torque; Exoskeleton; Actuator; Optimal design; Hamstring; Knee Joint; Kinematics; Simulation; Control theory; Swing,,,,,http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=JOJDCV_2011_v17n10_1021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5302/j.icros.2011.17.10.1021,,10.5302/j.icros.2011.17.10.1021,2088785162,,0,014-565-746-961-673; 023-360-950-534-182; 046-225-927-808-029; 048-830-113-682-517; 069-669-602-933-675; 081-903-032-858-93X; 088-951-821-089-329; 093-905-311-119-886; 119-274-818-086-853; 123-785-980-359-150,0

The rated working point is optimized according to the operating conditions of the motor. The effect of electromagnetic load on the extreme torque which mainly include ampoule number and the magnetic energy of the PM is researched. Due to the nonlinear saturation influence, the equivalent magnetic network model is established. The saturation torque discount factor is proposed to quantify the degree of the core magnetic saturation. Winding temperature model is presented to inspect the motor reliability. To verify the feasibility and accuracy of mathematical model analysis (MMA), the performance of the motor in different currents is investigated compared to the finite element analysis (FEA).

They are important for electromechanical servo systems, drivers for battery powered appliances and tools as well as electric vehicles. Both brushless DC motors and wound DC motors are common in electric and hybrid vehicles. The series wound DC motor is commonly used for high torque vehicle applications. The literature has many papers discussing permanent magnet DC motors but a very limited number of publications on analytical models for series wound DC motors, especially motor models that fit series wound DC motor test data available in the market place. An analytical model for a series wound DC motor is developed here based on physical principles including energy conservation. The model developed will be compared with models developed by other investigators. Available commercial test data for a series motor will be used to find model parameters for the analytical model and the accuracy of this model evaluated against the original test data. The model developed displays excellent accuracy well within the accuracy of the test data available. Typical model rms deviation from test data is under 2% for the commercial series wound DC motors evaluated.Copyright © 2009 by ASME",,,223,227,Engineering; Control engineering; Traction motor; Torque; Test data; Actuator; Mechatronics; Brushed DC electric motor; Servomechanism; DC motor,,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings/DSCC2009/48920/223/346390 https://nuclearengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings/DSCC2009/48920/223/346390 https://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings/DSCC2009/48920/223/346390 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1648158 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1648158,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/dscc2009-2549,,10.1115/dscc2009-2549,2085636337,,0,,2

To accomplish these functions, we propose a novel design for a parallel-type variable stiffness actuator (PVSA). The stiffness and position of a joint can be controlled simultaneously using the PVSA based on an antagonistic actuation inspired by the musculoskeletal system. The PVSA consists of a dual-cam follower mechanism, which acts like a human muscle, and a drive module with two motors. Each cam placed inside the dual cam-follower mechanism has two types of cam profile to provide a wide range of stiffness variation and collision safety. The use of the PVSA enables position and stiffness control to occur simultaneously. Furthermore, joint stiffness instantly decreases when the PVSA is subject to a high torque exceeding a pre-determined value, thereby improving collision safety. Experiments showed that the PVSA provides effective levels of variable stiffness and collision safety.",24,11,2315,2321,Collision; Engineering; Torque; Artificial intelligence; Actuator; Service robot; Stiffness; Joint stiffness; Robotics; Simulation; Control theory; Robot,,,,,https://koreauniv.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/compliant-actuation-of-parallel-type-variable-stiffness-actuator- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12206-010-0813-6 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12206-010-0813-6 http://www.j-mst.org/On_line/admin/files/22-J2009-11563_2315-2321-2322%EB%B0%B1_.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12206-010-0813-6,,10.1007/s12206-010-0813-6,2017718225,,0,001-403-569-169-760; 008-028-237-267-164; 020-321-725-770-989; 028-353-929-487-939; 041-868-751-316-262; 053-772-799-879-258; 054-523-154-954-90X; 064-756-044-304-316; 074-840-953-825-930; 084-513-953-682-452; 105-100-876-813-280; 109-679-941-056-425; 132-261-260-822-222; 172-964-778-350-401,24

Li; Jacob Siefert; David Bigelow,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>;                <jats:p>Traditionally, off-road mobile machines such as excavators and wheel loaders are primarily powered by hydraulics and throttling valves are used to control their work circuits. In recent years, two general trends are towards more energy efficient systems and electrification. With electrification, both efficiency and control performance can be improved by the elimination of throttling losses and the use of high-bandwidth inverter control. Electrification is generally accomplished with Electro-hydraulic actuators (EHA) but they are limited to lower powered systems due to the high cost of electric machines capable of high power or high torque. This paper presents preliminary results of a new system architecture for off-road vehicles to improve efficiency and control performance. The architecture combines hydraulic power and electric power in such a way that the majority of power is provided hydraulically while electric drives are used to modulate this power. The hybrid hydraulic-electric architecture (HHEA) and its rationale are described. In addition, a case study is presented to illustrate its operation, its potential for energy saving, and its benefits of component downsizing. The case study indicates that compared to a baseline load sensing system, the HHEA has the potential to reduce energy consumption by more than 50%. Furthermore, the torque capability of the electrical components need only be ∼ 28% of what is required for the direct application of EHA.</jats:p>",,,,,Architecture; Electronic circuit; Torque; Hydraulics; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Energy consumption; Computer science; Electronic component; Systems architecture,,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A011/1071789 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/a-hybrid-hydraulic-electric-architecture-hhea-for-high-power-off--2 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A011/1071789 https://electronicpackaging.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/FPST/proceedings/FPMC2019/59339/V001T01A011/1071789,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/fpmc2019-1628,,10.1115/fpmc2019-1628,2996480075,,0,,5

Saponara; Alberto Torasso; G. Saavedra Criado; B. Girouart,"Euclid is a Medium-Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015–2025 plan. Thales Alenia Space Italy has been selected as prime contractor for the Euclid design and implementation. The spacecraft will be launched in 2020 on a Soyuz launch vehicle from Kourou, to a large-amplitude orbit around the sun–earth libration point L2. The objective of Euclid is to understand the origin of the Universe’s accelerating expansion, by mapping large-scale structure over a cosmic time covering the last 10 billion years. The mission requires the ability to survey a large fraction of the extragalactic sky (i.e. portion of sky with latitude higher than 30 deg with respect to galactic plane) over its lifetime, with very high system stability (telescope, focal plane, spacecraft pointing) to minimize systematic effects. The AOCS is a key element to meet the scientific requirements. The AOCS design drivers are pointing performance and image quality (Relative Pointing Error over 700 s less than 25 m as, 68 % confidence level), and minimization of slew time between observation fields to meet the goal of completing the Wide Extragalactic Survey in 6 years. The first driver demands a Fine Guidance Sensor in the telescope focal plane for accurate attitude measurement and actuators with low noise and fine command resolution. The second driver requires high-torque actuators and an extended attitude control bandwidth. In the design, reaction wheels (RWL) and cold-gas micro-propulsion (MPS) are used in a synergetic and complementary way during different operational phases of the science mode. The RWL are used for performing the field slews, whereas during scientific observation they are stopped not to perturb the pointing by additional mechanical noise. The MPS is used for maintaining the reference attitude with high pointing accuracy during the scientific observation. This unconventional concept achieves the pointing performance with the shortest maneuver times, with significant mass savings with respect to the MPS-only solution.",7,2,71,85,Physics; Cardinal point; Aerospace engineering; Attitude control; Galactic plane; Reaction wheel; Cosmic Vision; Telescope; Spacecraft; Sky,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015CEAS....7...71B/abstract https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-015-0084-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12567-015-0084-2,,10.1007/s12567-015-0084-2,2017335557,,0,009-942-516-936-026; 019-337-257-359-072; 023-107-005-621-75X; 029-457-563-120-974; 039-889-289-549-98X,4

However, the motor are time-varying and highly nonlinear system which the parameters varied with increasing temperature and changes in drive frequency, load torque and phase difference of two-phase voltages. The investigations are focused on three parts, first we construct complex dynamic model of traveling-wave ultrasonic motor (TWUSM) by MATLAB/ SIMULINK in this paper, a hybrid model which combines the strength of the equivalent circuit method and the finite element method is derived, On the other hand, a novel controller and driving system are presented. For the part of control, we present a self-constructing recurrent fuzzy neural network for the speed control of a TWUSM to track periodic reference trajectories. Two types of online learning algorithms are the structure learning and the parameter learning. The structure learning has the ability of identifying whether the fuzzy rules are generated or not, while the parameter learning algorithm used the supervised gradient decent method to adjust the connected weights in the consequent part. When the system is in steady state, fuzzy decision-making method is used to delete unimportant fuzzy rules automatically, so that to get the simplest structure of SCRFNN while maintaining the good control performance.

We designed and built two tethered ankle exoskeletons with strong lightweight frames, comfortable three-point contact with the leg, and series elastic elements for improved torque control. Both devices have low mass (< 0.88 kg), are modular, structurally compliant in selected directions, and instrumented to measure joint angle and torque. The exoskeletons are actuated by an off-board motor, and torque is controlled using a combination of proportional feedback and damping injection with iterative learning during walking tests. We tested closed-loop torque control by commanding 50 N·m and 20 N·m linear chirps in desired torque while the exoskeletons were worn by human users, and measured bandwidths greater than 16 Hz and 21 Hz, respectively. During walking trials, we demonstrated 120 N·m peak torque and 2.0 N·m RMS torque tracking error. These performance measures compare favorably with existing devices and with human ankle musculature, and show that these exoskeletons can be used to rapidly explore a wide range of control techniques and robotic assistance paradigms as elements of versatile, high-performance testbeds.

Tsagarakis,"In recent years, several legged/wheeled robots have been developed, and their effective functionality in locomotion on uneven terrains has been proved. Many robotics researchers have been focusing on improving the locomotion speed as well as the stability and robustness of such robots. High-speed locomotion of robots is, however, subject to various design challenges, especially in the development of actuators. The robotic applications that require high-speed motion in high-torque operations along with the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions are not satisfied by the conventional robotic actuators deploying high-reduction gearings. In this work, we present a quasi-direct-drive actuator designed for continuous high-speed motions in high torque, such as wheeled motions in mobile robots or joint motions in dynamic-legged robots. The presented actuator exploits low-reduction gearing so that it can render over 26 Nm of continuous torque, while the actuator speed can exceed 37 rad/s. Such characteristics enable the exhibition of dynamic motions and can deal with large external impacts. The selection of the motor and design of the gearing unit was carried out iteratively so that commercial items with minimum customization could be employed and the outer diameters of the motor and the gearbox could match. A single-level planetary gearbox was devised for the reduction unit to ensure high back-drivability and transparency of the actuator, thereby making the actuator robust against external impacts and allowing for accurate torque control using motor current measurement. The gear set design was carried out based on the AGMA gear torque calculation. Given the radial space required for the gearbox to deal with the torque requirements, the actuator motor was chosen to be small in height (pancake type), which ensures high torque density within smaller dimensions at high-speed operation. The mechanical design of the actuator is presented in this paper, and the actuator’s specifications in terms of size and performance are compared with those of similar state-of-the-art actuators.",64,1,11,,Torque; Artificial intelligence; Actuator; Mobile robot; High torque; Robotics; Transmission (mechanics); Computer science; Control theory; Robot; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/64/1/11,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/iecat2020-08516,,10.3390/iecat2020-08516,3111265104,,0,,0

The actuators may be constructed to provide multiple step sizes. The motion generation mechanism of the stepper motors may be designed to lock the actuator at each motion step, thereby providing the actuator with a built-in precision in-position braking mechanism. The actuators may be powered pneumatically, hydraulically, electrically or via gas-generating charges. The actuators operating pneumatically or hydraulically may be constructed with non-metallic materials and be fully submersible, making them particularly suitable for use in medical, food, beverage and chemical industries and where electricity poses fire or explosion hazard.

Piezoelectric actuators offer flagship performance in this domain with its capability to actuate with resolution up to fraction of diameter of an atom. With important advantages like high accuracy, rapid response, high torque, compact form-factor they are being used several ultra-precise mechatronic systems. However, its performance is effected by severe nonlinearities, mostly hysteresis which needs to be tacked by proper controller design along with suitable plant model. This research first mathematically models the piezoelectric actuator as a second order plant using Dahl model for hysteresis. Parameters of the plant and nonlinear hysteretic term are experimentally identified using a commercially available piezoelectric actuator. An improved Internal Model Control approach is then explored which has a simpler structure than conventional IMC. As PID control is the most widely used control regime for practical usage, the research also presents an equivalent PID structure of the controller. The presence of system dead time has been considered and approximated using zero order ‘Pade’ approximation. Results suggest an improvement in the controller response over a traditional control in terms of step response, impulse disturbance as well as noisy environment.",,,,,Hysteresis; Nonlinear system; Dead time; Step response; Internal model; Computer science; PID controller; Control theory; Impulse (physics); Control theory,,,,,http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8701878/8709330/08709554.pdf?arnumber=8709554 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8709554,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iicpe.2018.8709554,,10.1109/iicpe.2018.8709554,2944164816,,0,011-697-901-404-89X; 018-024-326-022-016; 073-223-074-126-56X; 077-669-234-803-059; 087-342-123-313-303; 119-460-289-602-11X; 137-268-726-742-827; 155-233-484-668-582; 179-222-991-893-191,0

Toliyat; Pedram Boghrat,"In low speed, high torque actuation applications, such as the rotation of a ship’s weapons systems, and traction applications, such as electric ship propulsion, conventional design dictates that it is more cost effective and practical to build a high speed, low torque motor and couple it to a mechanical gear to achieve the appropriate torque and speed profile. Unfortunately, in these systems several disadvantages are also associated with the mechanical gear, such as extensive maintenance requirements, significant acoustic noise, and decreased reliability. This paper will propose the use of magnetically-geared motor (MGM) direct drive system (DDS) as an alternative means of achieving this low speed, high torque output. An MGM DDS is a relatively novel concept which integrates a magnetic gear and a motor into a single compact device with a high torque output while possessing all the advantages of a magnetic gear, including: improved reliability, reduced vibrations, reduced acoustic noise, physical isolation between the rotors, and the potential for increased system level efficiency. The limited literature on radial flux MGM DDSs will be reviewed and a novel axial flux MGM DDS will be proposed along with an analysis of its unique advantages for naval applications.",,,,,Propulsion; Direct torque control; Electrical engineering; Non-circular gear; Engineering; Torque; Noise; Automotive engineering; Vibration; Torque motor; Magnetic gear,,,,,,,,,2187482763,,0,,0

The Venus environment represents several extremes including high temperature (460°C), high pressure (~9 MPa.), and potentially corrosive (condensed sulfuric acid droplets that adhere to surfaces during entry) environments. This technology challenge requires new actuator and sensor designs that can withstand these extreme conditions. In addition a variety of industrial applications could benefit from an extended operating temperature range of actuators and sensors. Piezoelectric materials can potentially operate over a wide temperature range reaching as low as -270°C to as high as +650°C. Single crystals, like LiNbO 3 , have a Curie temperature that is higher than +1000°C. In order to investigate the feasibility of producing actuators/sensors that can operate under these conditions we have initiated a study of the properties of a variety of piezoelectric materials in the temperature range 250C to 5000C. These piezoelectric materials were chosen because they are solid state and can be designed as actuators to provide high torque, stroke, and speed. However the feasibility of this critical actuation capability has never been demonstrated under the extreme conditions mentioned above.

084-454-226-688-279,Efficiency optimization of the push-belt CVT by variator slip control,,2006,,,,,,B. Bonsen,"Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) are becoming increasingly popular in automotive applications. What makes them attractive is the ability to vary the transmission ratio in a stepless manner without interrupting the torque transfer. This increases comfort by eliminating the discrete shifting events and increases performance by choosing the most suitable transmission ratio for every driving situation. Using a CVT could potentially save more than 15% of fuel consumption compared to manually shifted vehicles. This figure however is never met, because of the internal losses in the CVTs in production today. If the losses in a CVT can be lowered, then the overall fuel economy of a CVT equipped vehicle will be improved with the same amount. With current CVTs ranging around 80% efficiency, an improvement of around 10% is possible compared to currently available CVTs if an optimal actuation and control system is used. This thesis is about the optimization of the control system of the CVT by using slip as the control variable. This is part of a larger project focussing on the entire actuation and control system. Also a CVT with Electro-Mechanically Pulley Actuation (EMPAct) is developed aiming to reduce the power consumption of the CVT actuation system. Combined, these two projects aim to improve the fuel economy of the CK2 transmission from Jatco with 10%. Models for the clamping forces and traction in the variator are compared. The continuous belt model is compared with a pushbelt model. A parameter study shows the influence of the model parameters on the outcome of the models. The output of the models are also compared to measured values. A nonlinear dynamic model for slip in the variator is derived. This model can be linearized in certain operating points. This model can be used for the design of a control system, simulation of slip in the variator or for analysis. Measurement of slip directly is not possible, therefore a good estimation method is needed. Several estimations of slip in the variator are compared. The position measurement of the pulley is used in the measurements shown in this thesis. Measurements on a beltbox testrig are given that clearly show a relation between slip and efficiency and slip and traction. This relation changes as a function of other parameters like speed, ratio, clamping force etc. Estimation of the efficiency potential of the pushbelt variator shows that a potential of between 5% for high torques and 20% for low torques exists. A slip control system is developed to show the possible efficiency improvement. First, a beltbox setup is used to test a simplified slip controlled variator. Ratio changing is not taken into account in this setup. After successful tests with this setup another setup is used that incorporates a Jatco CK2 transmission and an internal combustion engine.

Otten; Jeffrey H. Lang; Sangbae Kim,"In this paper, we introduce the design principles for highly efficient legged robots and the implementation of the principles on the MIT Cheetah robot. Three major energy loss modes during locomotion are heat losses through the actuators, losses through the transmission, and the interaction losses that includes all losses of the system interacting with the environment. We propose four design principles that minimize these losses: employment of high torque density motors, low impedance transmission, energy regenerative electronics and a design architecture that minimizes the leg inertia. We present the design features of the MIT cheetah robot as an embodiment of these principles.

SEAs provide more accurate force and impedance control than conventional rigid actuators. They are ideal for robots and machines that need to interact safely with the environment. The majority of existing SEAs uses brushless or brushed DC motors as the actuators. The advantages of using step motors as the actuators of SEAs have not received enough attention. Step motors have much higher torque-to-weight ratio and torque-to-inertia ratio than other DC motors. Hence they can provide better stability and high-speed accuracy of force control while maintaining lightweight. When the rotor position feedback is used, step motors can achieve accurate dynamic position response smoothly. This paper develops the dynamic model of a linear series elastic step motor and presents its prototype.

Khorrami,"In this paper, a robust adaptive nonlinear dy- namic controller is designed to achieve practical stabiliza- tion for position tracking error of a voltage-fed permanent- magnet stepper motor. The control design is an output- feedback design that utilizes only rotor position rneasure- ments. Rotor velocity and stator phase currents are not available for feedback. Furthermore, the only motor param- eter that is required to be known is the time constant of the electrical subsystem. Adaptations are utilized so that no other knowledge of motor parameters is required. The proposed controller is robust to load torques, friction, cog- ging forces, and other disturbances satisfying certain bound- s. These results can also be extended to other classes of motors. I. INTRODUCTION Permanent magnet (PM) stepper motors are electrome- chanical actuators which are popularly used in position- ing applications. The rotor consists of a permanent mag- net with toothed end caps and the stator is a salient pole structure, with each pole having between two to six teeth (Figure 1). The stator poles are equipped with windings which are energized sequentially to produce the stepping action of the motor. This eliminates the need for me- chanical brushes. Compared with variable reluctance type motors, permanent magnet stepper motors have the ad- vantages of small step length (typically 1.8 degrees) and a higher torque/volume ratio(l). This makes them suit- able in applications where high torque and high resolution positioning is required.",,,,,Electrical engineering; Switched reluctance motor; Engineering; Torque; Magnet; Rotor (electric); Stepper; Magnetic reluctance; Stator; Control theory; Control theory,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7676/20975/00973875.pdf http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=973875,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7676/20975/00973875.pdf,,,2189082933,,0,009-165-462-920-403; 009-198-454-289-544; 009-733-231-739-108; 010-209-019-286-716; 012-981-046-749-938; 014-836-457-492-542; 018-537-298-265-179; 039-287-765-745-351; 059-686-126-243-404; 072-497-225-932-342; 132-736-638-276-291; 171-382-778-903-065; 183-555-720-366-154,0

The PFPE greases were chosen for this evaluation because their oils have a very low vapor pressure and they will not volatilize in the disk drive. Base oil viscosity, PTFE particle size and percentage of oil content were varied. The rheological properties of complex viscosity, storage and loss moduli, and loss factor were measured. Percent oil was determined using thermal gravimetric analysis. The thickener’s PTFE particle sizes were measured and their shapes were imaged using scanning electron microscopy. Bearing low speed torque and bearing noise tests were performed to evaluate the effect of the grease on bearing performance. The head settle track misregistration (TMR) was measured on disk drives to measure the effect of bearing lubrication on the servo performance. Generally, greases with high base oil viscosity had the lowest complex viscosity. Greases with highest viscosity PFPE oils had the highest torque and lowest noise. Greases with large PTFE particles had high loss factors and exhibited high torque and noise levels. High PTFE thickener to PFPE oil ratio (thicker grease) causes the bearings to have fluctuations in torque and noise levels.

Karunanidhi,"Abstract More electric aircraft initiative has led to Fly-By-Wire (FBW) and Power-By-Wire (PBW) technologies. PBW technology has several advantages and has potential for weight reduction and energy saving compared to conventional hydraulic system. Recent development in aviation technology have combined the electric and hydraulic system and arrived at high performance Electro Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA) system. It is a one of the PBW technology which aims at replacing the centralized hydraulic system by a local self-contained and compact actuator system. It is an emerging technology which combines the benefits of conventional hydraulic system and direct drive actuators, like the high energy efficiency, high dynamic response, high torque to mass ratio and high maintainability. EHA system was initially introduced in aircraft for flight control system. Most of the current research literatures considered the EHA system with symmetric actuator configuration. This is because, most of the aircraft application uses symmetric cylinder. However in case of industrial application, asymmetric actuators are predominantly used. An indigenous experimental setup of EHA system with asymmetric actuator has been developed with sensors and instrumentation. In this paper, the dynamic analysis, position tracking and control of the EHA system by varying the speed of drive motor has been established using a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller.

Las ortesis activas o exoesqueletos de asistencia a la marcha humana son dispositivos de uso externo para pacientes con problemas de movilidad que aportan la fuerza y movilidad que le falta al usuario. El uso de estos dispositivos puede ser optimo diario, integrado en el mayor numero de actividades cotidianas posible. Pero las ortesis activas comerciales actuales no tienen autonomia suficiente para proporcionar la potencia consumida durante toda una jornada. Las baterias actuales no proporcionan los requerimientos de potencia que demandan estas ortesis activas. Aumentar la autonomia energetica se ha convertido en uno de los grandes retos para el desarrollo de estos estos dispositivos. En general, el consumo energetico de los robots bipedos de uso general es significativamente mayor que el de los humanos u otros bipedos mamiferos. A partir de un minucioso analisis de la marcha humana y la anatomia de la locomocion desde el punto de vista energetico y basandose en el estado del arte de la robotica, en esta tesis se propone una estrategia hibrida para reducir el consumo energetico en la marcha, primando la aplicabilidad y la fiabilidad para implementarla en el exoesqueleto ATLAS. En el campo de los robots bipedos se distinguen fundamentalmente tres estrategias de eficiencia energetica: 1. Optimizar las trayectorias a seguir por el extremo de la pierna para minimizar una funcion objetivo relacionada con la energia consumida. 2. Aprovechar la dinamica pasiva (energia potencial y cinetica) de la pierna del robot para realizar el movimiento subactuado o con poca inyeccion de energia. 3. En el diseno de la extremidad robotica, modificar su dinamica incluyendo elementos y mecanismos elasticos en las articulaciones para reducir las perdidas de energia en los impactos con el suelo y para acumular y soltar energia en las fases de la marcha donde el comportamiento energetico de las articulaciones sea el mismo que el de un elemento elastico. En esta tesis se propone una aproximacion hibrida, que trata de aunar los beneficios de cada estrategia anterior. Habitualmente los pacientes objetivo, hacia los que esta enfocado el diseno de estos exoesqueletos, tienen limites articulares importantes, flexos de cadera, rodilla y una marcada limitacion en el rango de flexion en el tobillo. Asi, la primera estrategia presentada no es directamente aplicable, puesto que la trayectoria del extremo efectivo en las ortesis activas debe calcularse respetando las restricciones anatomicas del paciente. La segunda y tercera estrategias planteadas se logran en esta tesis proponiendo e implementado un esquema de control de rigidez en un actuador de rigidez variable (VSA). Gracias a esta estrategia de variacion de rigidez se pueden implementar en una misma articulacion estrategias de control basadas en la dinamica pasiva en la marcha, mientras que se puede aportar el par necesario para un control rigido en posicion en fases de mayor demanda de par, permitiendo asi subactuacion en fases de la marcha donde inercia inherente al movimiento es suficiente para mantenerlo y tambien aportando el alto par necesario para que la ortesis realice movimientos mas versatiles y no ciclicos, como maniobras de sentar y levantar al paciente. A su vez, estableciendo la rigidez adecuada a la articulacion, se reduce el consumo en los cambios de direccion de la articulacion y se puede almacenar y liberar energia en ciertas fases.

The intended use as an assistive device for daily life activities still encounters barriers to practical implementation. Current batteries cannot meet the long-term power requirements for these devices, which need to operate for long periods. This issue has become a major challenge in the development of these portable robots. Conversely, legged locomotion in animals and humans is efficient. This thesis explores the methods to reduce energy consumption in the motion control of gait exoskeletons and especially its applicability and feasibility. From a thorough analysis of the human gait from the energetic point of view and based on the state of development of robotics, a hybrid strategy is proposed to reduce energy consumption in the gait cycle. Three major research areas can be distinguished in energy-efficient biped walking robots: _ The first research area focuses on developing optimal gait trajectories for active walking robots. These trajectories are obtained with optimization procedures to minimize an objective function. _ The second research area focuses on exploiting the passive-dynamic of the robot legs. In the first place, the research is focused on non-active mechanisms that descend ramps taking advantage of the energy of gravity and the elastic energy of the impact. Subsequently, by applying these concepts, it is possible to make robots that walk on flat ground providing only the energy, previously contributed by gravity, to take advantage of the elastic energy of the impact. _ In the third area, the leg dynamics is modified by including passive or active elastic mechanisms in the joints to reduce energy losses caused by the impact with the ground and to store and release energy for an improved energy-efficiency. In this thesis, a hybrid approach is proposed, because several strategies to reduce consumption are going to be applied, taking advantage of the benefits of each area. The trajectory in pediatric active orthoses is calculated according to the physiological needs of the patient. The gait control approach will explode the natural dynamics of the leg; actively modifying joints dynamics by the use of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA). By the application strategy of stiffness variation, control strategies based on passive dynamics can be implemented in the same joint, while the necessary torque can be provided for a rigid control in position in phases of higher torque demand, allowing subactuation in gait phases where inherent inertia is enough to take advantage of it and also providing the high torque necessary for the orthosis to perform more versatile and non-cyclic movements, such as sitting and standing maneuvers. In turn, by establishing the adequate stiffness to the joint, consumption is reduced in changes of direction of the joint and energy can be stored and released in certain gait phases. The locomotion control strategies proposed have been validated through their implementation in the ATLAS active orthotic prototype. In this experiment, the importance of the variation of stiffness in relation to an efficient gait is reflected. This hybrid strategy achieves a reduction in energy consumption of 40%, while maintaining the robustness and reliability of the active orthosis with stiff actuators. The results of the research work have led to 8 publications in indexed scientific journals and 14 articles in international congresses, several of which have been prizes for their scientific and technical excellence. The doctoral thesis has had a relevant impact in the area of rehabilitation robotics since its results are being used in real environments, since pediatric gait exoskeletons, transferred to the technology-based company, are being used in two hospitals in the therapy of neuromuscular diseases in childhood.",,,,,Humanities; Political science; Gait cycle; High torque; Energy expenditure; Lower limb; Active orthosis; Daily life activities; Assistive device; Gait control,,,,,http://oa.upm.es/52593/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=229138,http://oa.upm.es/52593/,,,2901677039,,0,,1

This mechanism enables the swashplate to tilt in all directions and move vertically as one unit. The lower stationary plate is mounted on the main rotor mast and connected to the cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. There are similar pushrods known as pitch links connected to the upper rotating plate. These pitch links are connected to the pitch horns and control the pitch of individual blades. In this study, the pitch links of the model helicopter are replaced by a semi compliant mechanism. This mechanism is directly connected to the pitch horns to control the pitch of the individual blades. The actuation of the bars can be achieved by using high torque stepper or servo motors. These precise low and high amplitude outputs are specifically required for the cyclic and collective controls of the helicopter swashplate. The compliant swashplate mechanism can be fabricated as a single piece using an injection molding technique or by 3D printing. The mechanism is modeled by two similar vector loops in two different planes. The mathematical model of the plate motion and the forces on the mechanism links are developed and simulated using MATLAB and Simulink, and initial results are discussed in this paper. This mechanism would be applied to the helicopter directional control where the plate in the pitch-roll mechanism would serve as the swash plate of the helicopter.</jats:p>",,,,,Servomotor; Torque; Automotive engineering; Swashplate; MATLAB; Computer science; Compliant mechanism,,,,,https://electronicpackaging.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings/DSCC2018/51913/V003T30A002/270976 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings/DSCC2018/51913/V003T30A002/270976 https://turbomachinery.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-abstract/DSCC2018/51913/V003T30A002/270976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/dscc2018-8944,,10.1115/dscc2018-8944,2901919141,,0,,2

The actuators are responsible for moving, manipulating, displacing, pushing and executing any action that is needed by the mechanism. There are many types and principles of actuation that are responsible for these movements ranging from electromagnetic, electroactive, thermo-mechanic, piezoelectric, electrostrictive etc. Actuators are readily available from commercial producers but there is a great need for reducing their size, increasing their efficiency and reducing their weight. Studies at JPL’s Non Destructive Evaluation and Advanced Actuators (NDEAA) Laboratory have been focused on the use of piezoelectric stacks and novel designs taking advantage of piezoelectric’s potential to provide high torque/force density actuation and high electromechanical conversion efficiency. The actuators/motors that have been developed and reviewed in this paper are operated by various horn configurations as well as the use of pre-stress flexures that make them thermally stable and increases their coupling efficiency. The use of monolithic designs that pre-stress the piezoelectric stack eliminates the use of compression stress bolt. These designs enable the embedding of developed solid-state motors/actuators in any structure with the only macroscopically moving parts are the rotor or the linear translator.

Kermani,"In this paper, a new adaptive control scheme is proposed to compensate for the magnetic hysteresis in magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based actuators. MR actuators offer high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios. Input and output shafts are mechanically decoupled in MR actuators, providing lower inertia compared to the same power geared motors. Additionally, geared motors typically add significant noises on the torque/force measurements. Noises on the torques/forces can be attenuated in MR actuators due to fluidic connections between the input and output shafts, facilitating high fidelity torque/force control. Despite these unique characteristics, magnetic circuits within MR actuators create hysteresis between the input current and output torque that negatively affects the quality of torque/force control and the repeatability of MR actuators. A hysteresis compensation scheme is essential to gain repeatable and high-quality actuation. To this end, we propose an adaptive control method that estimates both hysteresis and uncertain parameters of the magnetic circuit and cancels nonlinearities based on feedback linearization technique. A set of experiments is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results are compared to a proportional-integral-derivative controller.",21,3,1336,1344,Adaptive control; Magnetorheological fluid; Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Input/output; Magnetic circuit; Control theory; Control theory; Feedback linearization,,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7398108/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7398108/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2016.2524673,,10.1109/tmech.2016.2524673,2345287054,,0,001-547-237-980-189; 005-234-888-101-772; 011-349-268-415-006; 013-230-964-000-853; 016-220-815-752-760; 021-939-345-175-089; 030-395-689-296-021; 030-703-441-659-492; 031-198-973-607-943; 032-529-270-932-432; 033-927-853-470-073; 034-337-381-194-969; 038-381-279-325-583; 038-795-494-143-993; 048-002-050-280-436; 048-661-668-107-503; 054-063-411-879-951; 055-230-132-416-251; 056-490-640-532-539; 056-993-062-615-432; 060-080-559-971-297; 062-415-168-142-891; 063-332-837-575-356; 063-551-301-166-327; 068-856-526-933-549; 076-620-239-978-620; 077-799-431-068-95X; 080-138-369-625-742; 083-285-000-094-08X; 090-593-950-621-523; 108-051-099-144-422; 109-332-383-560-359; 110-011-534-867-058; 117-668-659-164-277; 119-421-452-361-992; 119-879-947-515-388; 120-834-516-173-44X; 126-890-654-239-536; 133-558-311-275-921; 141-903-924-818-081; 162-238-350-940-225; 179-886-315-358-101,15

The motors yield an acceleration five times that of gravity at the robot end point without overheating. High-torque low-speed brushless AC synchronous motors are used to power the robot. A graphite-epoxy composite is used to construct the robot links. A four-node parallel processor has been used to control the robot.

For this purpose Control Moment Gyros (CMG) needs to be applied to an attitude control actuator of a small agile satellite, because CMG can generate high torque effectively. CMG has a singularity problem which affects energy consumption and rapid actuation of CMG. In order to settle these problems we proposed feedforward control logic using energy optimal path planning by Fourier Basis Algorithm (FBA). However, this logic does not hold robustness with several errors and disturbances. Therefore, this paper designs a feedback control system so as to obtain robustness with errors of initial CMG gimbal angles generated by natural environmental disturbances. The designed system is characterized by using the system’s limit state, which is a new defined variable and is predicted by numerical integrals using nominal control inputs. The results of the several numerical simulations show the availability of the proposed logic about robustness with these errors, energy consumption, and safe use of CMG.",,,2009,6205,Gimbal; Engineering; Control engineering; Attitude control; Actuator; Energy consumption; Feed forward; Basis function; Control theory; Motion planning; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2009-6205 https://keio.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/design-of-feedback-control-system-using-nominal-inputs-for-satell,http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2009-6205,,10.2514/6.2009-6205,2121306551,,0,010-733-531-058-537; 015-084-947-942-46X; 017-063-257-430-088; 040-118-460-665-156; 049-396-177-317-620; 054-843-899-956-320; 064-477-933-287-34X; 123-998-241-901-072; 180-836-225-200-888,1

Auer,"Abstract : For precision three-axis attitude control of space vehicles, a Doubled Gimballed Momentum Wheel (DGMW) as attitude actuator is a favorable approach. A high reliability DGMW of modular design with two momentum wheels and two direct drive ultra high resolution stepper motors plus pick-offs per gimal axis (full redundancy; no caging during launch) was designed, built and qualification tested, together with an associated wheel and gimbal drive electronics. In addition, extensive system tests were performed on a three-axis air bearing table which proved the excellent control capabilities of this DGMW. Besides the measurement under stationary conditions with an accuracy of 18 sec of arc, also the transient behavior was studied. Due to the high torque capability (up to 0.2 Nm around the momentum wheel axis and up to 1 Nm around the gimbal axes) rapid and accurate pointing and repointing of spacecraft are possible. Therefore, the DGMW system can be designed into tracking loops and assure continuous pointing of spacecraft instruments with a rapid assignment capability.

Some sorts of constructions and characteristics of USMs have been reported so far. Of these USMs, a traveling-wave type USM has many characteristics such as high torque at low speed range, large holding torque based upon frictional force, flexible free forms, compactness in size and low magnetic noise. In practice, an inherent mechanical resonant frequency and a velocity amplitude of USM are largely changed according to operating temperature due to frictional drive, load disturbance torque, and applied voltage levels. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new control system which solves these items and always supplies the required power with high-efficiency and high-performance in the practical applications. This paper is mainly a newly-proposed sensorless high-performance control scheme of inverter-fed ultrasonic motor, which is based upon a control system technology with two feedbacks incorporating an automatic resonant frequency tracking and a constant velocity amplitude control strategies.

Di Indonesia tidak dijumpai servo dengan torsi tinggi. Hanya motor DC yang banyak di pasaran. Untuk menekan biaya pengembangan robot lengan exoskeleton, penelitian menggunakan motor DC. Sistem kontrol diperlukan untuk membuat sebuah motor DC bergerak seperti layaknya motor servo. Sistem kontrol logika Fuzzy paling tepat untuk mengontrol motor DC. Sebuah prototype robot lengan exoskeleton dibuat. Motor DC sebagai penggerak lengan robot. Sistem kontrol Fuzzy pada robot dibuat menggunakan software SIMULINK/MATLAB. Gerak robot dibatasi dari 0o sampai 90o. Sistem akan diuji menggunakan SIMULINK/MATLAB dan dilakukan dengan interface prototype exoskeleton. SIMULINK/Matlab memudahkan pembuatan Logika Fuzzy yang dapat mengontrol Motor DC bergerak layaknya motor servo.

Data parameter sistem kontrol Logika Fuzzy lebih baik daripada sistem kontrol sederhana yang dibuat.&#x0D;; Humans want to be born in a perfect life, both physically and spiritually. But in reality, humans are far from perfect. One of the imperfections is arm paralysis. The current study is an exoskeleton robot. The exoskeleton is the supporting structure of the outer part of the body. This robot has a prospective application for rehabilitation or aids. Successful exoskeleton control systems rely on better understanding of the biomechanics of human body motion and the sensory mechanisms that are also important problems in human-robot physical interactions. The elbow arm robot developed by Thomas uses servo motors as actuators. The heavier the load, the greater the servo torque. In Indonesia there is no servo with high torque. Only DC motors are in the market. To reduce the development cost of robotic arm of exoskeleton, research using DC motor. A control system is needed to make a DC motor move like a servo motor. Fuzzy logic control system is most appropriate for control of DC motors. A prototype of an exoskeleton robot arm is made. DC motor as a actuator robot. Fuzzy control system on the robot is made using SIMULINK / MATLAB software. Robot motion is limited from 0o to 90o. The system will be tested using SIMULINK / MATLAB and done with prototype exoskeleton interface.

Kermani,"Abstract In this paper, the presence of limit cycles in the behaviour of antagonistically coupled magneto-rheological (MR) actuators is investigated. The actuator considered in this paper offers high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios, for inherent safe actuation. While the antagonistic arrangement is beneficial in improving the actuator performance and eliminating backlash, it may result in limit cycles when the actuator operates in a position control loop. The occurrence of a limit cycle depends on the parameters of the actuator as well as the controller. An in-depth analysis is carried out in this paper to establish a connection between the system parameters and the limit cycle occurrence. Moreover, sufficient conditions for avoiding limit cycles are derived specifically for a proportional-derivative (PD) controller. Simulations and experimental results validate the analysis and provide insights into conditions under which limit cycles are observed in the operation of antagonistic MR actuators.",35,,92,101,Engineering; Control engineering; Nonlinear system; Actuator; Backlash; Magneto rheological; System parameters; Position control; Control theory; Control theory; Limit cycle,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967066114002688,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conengprac.2014.11.006,,10.1016/j.conengprac.2014.11.006,2074977088,,0,003-255-987-433-721; 008-345-966-188-270; 030-703-441-659-492; 031-198-973-607-943; 033-927-853-470-073; 038-381-279-325-583; 038-795-494-143-993; 042-164-878-478-198; 048-002-050-280-436; 050-203-680-948-472; 058-031-107-565-340; 061-976-301-837-048; 063-332-837-575-356; 076-620-239-978-620; 083-285-000-094-08X; 094-310-209-901-461; 108-311-791-658-620; 120-834-516-173-44X; 126-890-654-239-536; 162-238-350-940-225; 169-275-099-201-306; 183-174-952-905-007,1

Strolz; Claudia Ehinger; Martin Buss,"To enable a realistic virtual prototyping of both actuated and unactuated rotatory car doors, a dedicated haptic device is developed. A fundamental issue is the derivation of the specific requirements for this interface, which is done based on knowledge of the typical user interaction with a car door and a comprehensive model of the dynamics of an actuated as well as an unactuated car door. The findings are that the device should only exhibit one rotatory degree-of-freedom, which should be actuated by a direct drive with a high torque output (≥ 100Nm) and very high position resolution (≥ 16Bit). A suitable direct-drive is selected and combined with other elements to form a backlash-free, very stiff haptic device. Due to both force and acceleration sensing, it can serve for the haptic rendering of actuated as well as unactuated car doors.

The feature of the proposed knee othosis is to drive a knee joint with independent actuation during swing and stance phases, which can allow an actuator with fast rotation to control swing motions and an actuator with high torque to control stance motions, respectively. The quadriceps device operates in five-bar links with 2-DOF motions during swing phase and is changed to six-bar links during stance phase by the contact motion to the patella device. The hamstring device operates in a slider-crank mechanism for entire gait cycle. The suggested kinematic model will allow a robotic knee orthosis to use compact and light actuators with full support during walking. However, the proposed orthosis must use additional linkages than a simple four-bar mechanism. To maximize the benefit of reducing the actuators power by using the developed kinematic design, it is necessary to minimize total weight of the device, while keeping necessary actuator performances of torques and angular velocities for support. In this paper, we use a SGA (Simple Genetic Algorithm) to minimize sum of total link lengths and motor power by reducing the weight of the novel knee orthosis. To find feasible parameters, kinematic constraints of the hamstring and quadriceps mechanisms have been applied to the algorithm. The proposed optimization scheme could reduce sum of total link lengths to half of the initial value. The proposed optimization scheme can be applied to reduce total weight of general multi-linkages while keeping necessary actuator specifications.",17,10,1021,1028,Engineering; Torque; Exoskeleton; Actuator; Hamstring; Knee Joint; Kinematics; Simulation; Control theory; Swing; Linkage (mechanical),,,,,http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Article/NODE01952957,http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Article/NODE01952957,,,1918782136,,0,,0

Flywheel is a common attitude control device on spacecraft that provides precise control at an easy rate. However, rapid response is hardly achieved since low reaction torque is available applying flywheel. The purpose in this paper is to improve the response of attitude control device with flywheel. Brake equipment is mounted on the flywheel in order to raise the maximum torque. Maximum torque is raised dramatically utilizing the braking torque to the attitude control. Twin drive system is applied to this attitude control device so that the braking torque works in both rotation directions. It also made possible to charge the momentum without any interference to attitude control. The prototype of the attitude control device is constructed in order to examine the performance of the proposed mechanism.

102-337-764-030-915,Compliant aerial manipulation.,2019-01-15,2019,dissertation,,,,,Alejandro Suárez Fernández-Miranda,"The aerial manipulation is a research field which proposes the integration of robotic manipulators in aerial platforms, typically multirotors – widely known as “drones” – or autonomous helicopters. The development of this technology is motivated by the convenience to reduce the time, cost and risk associated to the execution of certain operations or tasks in high altitude areas or difficult access workspaces. Some illustrative application examples are the detection and insulation of leaks in pipe structures in chemical plants, repairing the corrosion in the blades of wind turbines, the maintenance of power lines, or the installation and retrieval of sensor devices in polluted areas. Although nowadays it is possible to find a wide variety of commercial multirotor platforms with payloads from a few gramps up to several kilograms, and flight times around thirty minutes, the development of an aerial manipulator is still a technological challenge due to the strong requirements relative to the design of the manipulator in terms of very low weight, low inertia, dexterity, mechanical robustness and control.;  The main contribution of this thesis is the design, development and experimental validation of several prototypes of lightweight (<2 kg) and compliant manipulators to be integrated in multirotor platforms, including human-size dual arm systems, compliant joint arms equipped with human-like finger modules for grasping, and long reach aerial manipulators. Since it is expected that the aerial manipulator is capable to execute inspection and maintenance tasks in a similar way a human operator would do, this thesis proposes a bioinspired design approach, trying to replicate the human arm in terms of size, kinematics, mass distribution, and compliance. This last feature is actually one of the key concepts developed and exploited in this work. Introducing a flexible element such as springs or elastomers between the servos and the links extends the capabilities of the manipulator, allowing the estimation and control of the torque/force, the detection of impacts and overloads, or the localization of obstacles by contact. It also improves safety and efficiency of the manipulator, especially during the operation on flight or in grabbing situations, where the impacts and contact forces may damage the manipulator or destabilize the aerial platform. Unlike most industrial manipulators, where force-torque control is possible at control rates above 1 kHz, the servo actuators typically employed in the development of aerial manipulators present important technological limitations: no torque feedback nor control, only position (and in some models, speed) references, low update rates (<100 Hz), and communication delays. However, these devices are still the best solution due to their high torque to weight ratio, low cost, compact design, and easy assembly and integration. In order to cope with these limitations, the compliant joint arms presented here estimate and control the wrenches from the deflection of the spring-lever transmission mechanism introduced in the joints, measured at joint level with encoders or potentiometers, or in the Cartesian space employing vision sensors. Note that in the developed prototypes, the maximum joint deflection is around 25 degrees, which corresponds to a deviation in the position of the end effector around 20 cm for a human-size arm. The capabilities and functionalities of the manipulators have been evaluated in fixed base test-bench firstly, and then in outdoor flight tests, integrating the arms in different commercial hexarotor platforms. Frequency characterization, position/force/impedance control, bimanual grasping, arm teleoperation, payload mass estimation, or contact-based obstacle localization are some of the experiments presented in this thesis that validate the developed prototypes.",,,,,Servo; Control engineering; Torque; Payload; Teleoperation; Impedance control; Multirotor; Kinematics; Computer science; Robot end effector,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=210901 https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/81917,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=210901,,,2911285640,,0,,1

The NESM employs a self-aligning mechanism based on passive rotational joints to smoothly self-align the robot's rotational axes to the user's ones. Compliant yet high-torque series-elastic actuators allow the NESM to safely interact with the user, particularly in response to sudden unpredicted movements, such as those caused by spastic contractions. The NESM control system provides a variety of rehabilitation exercises, enabling the customization of therapy to patients exhibiting a range of movement capabilities.

Pitch links are actuated by high torque servo motors. Kinematic analysis of the entire mechanism is obtained by integrating vector closure loop equations. Modeling of small length flexural pivots is achieved by fitting a high order polynomial to the load deflection curve obtained from both pseudo rigid body modeling (PRBM) and MSc Adams analysis. Effects of the thickness and length of the rigid and flexures on deflection of flexible segments are analyzed experimentally. Experimental setup is built by 3D printing mechanism parts using polylactic acid (PLA) and assembling together with ball bearings and pin joints.

In this paper, we present the development and the experimental evaluation of a new actuator, aimed at improving the torque density and mechanical efficiency of actuated robotic joints, and enhancing the portability and effectiveness of robotic systems engaged in biomechanical applications such as rehabilitation robots and wearable exoskeletons. The new actuator, called the Gear Bearing Drive (GBD), consists of a two-stage planetary gear arrangement coupled through the planets and driven by an external rotor brushless motor that is inscribed within the input stage sun gear. This planetary configuration enables for incredible high-speed reductions and allows for embedding the motor directly within the gearbox saving significant space on the actuator length.

However, these actuators have a dead-zone property, that is, they cannot be driven if it must be applied a signal having a driving frequency near the resonance frequency or a high voltage above a certain voltage. Therefore, it is difficult to drive ultrasonic actuators at low-speed. In this note, we propose a method for low-speed driving of a standing-wave-type ultrasonic actuator which can drive using one phase signal. In this method, an intermittent signal generated using a standard PC is supplied to the actuator instead of a continuous signal.

106-338-845-189-821,Design of a hydraulic transmission system with series elastic element for a knee joint gait training application,,2018,,,,,,Rick Brons,"The restoration of the walking function of paraplegic patients requires long and extensive training. Physicians themselves are not able to provide this training due to the physical labour required. Robots and soft exoskeletons are in development to assist the physicians in this task, however, they are either bulky and restrictive or lack a method to actuate the knee joint. This research explores if a hydraulic system with elastic element is able to actuate a human knee joint during gait training. The hydraulic system is required to provide a torque of 75Nm with a bandwidth of 4Hz, the large force bandwidth, and a torque of 20Nm over a bandwidth of 12Hz, the small force bandwidth. The system must fit on a knee joint and impose the least amount of restrictions on the patient. Concepts that were identified as possible solutions in a previous literature review included a hydrostatic transmission, a system with a master rotary pump and a rotary slave actuator, a dual-acting hydraulic cylinder, and a master slave hydraulic cylinder system. Preliminary open loop simulation results suggest that the Hydrostatic transmission could give better performance in Torque transmission, size, and complexity. The bandwidth performance for both concepts was equal. The simulation model of the hydrostatic concept is expanded to include DC motor/driver dynamics, knee dynamics in swing phase, and ground reaction forces in stance phase. A physical test bed is designed to evaluate the simulation results with a real-world counterpart. Open loop and closed loop with PI controller results showed a significant decrease in the output torque magnitude for the real-world system, up to a factor 13 smaller. The output torque is decreased by the higher friction, slow pressure build-up and leakages in the real-world system. These factors are in part caused by the design choices made for the test bed design, such as the over-the-counter parts and usage of a 3D printed spring. Failure of the spring was observed at high torque and low frequency input signal. This was made worse by the large initial overshoot of the system in the closed loop tests. A more precise control scheme than the PI controller should be designed to prevent breakage. The real-world system is stable and the bandwidth of the system was larger than the 4Hz that is required for the application. For future research a smaller custom hydraulic loop will need to be created to alleviate the friction and leakage issues. Only then will a hydraulic system with series elastic element actuate a human knee to help a paraplegic patient walk again.",,,,,Transmission system; Hydraulic machinery; Torque; Open-loop controller; Actuator; Master/slave; Computer science; PID controller; Hydraulic cylinder; Control theory,,,,,http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:15ecc5a7-1279-4b82-81c4-394ee1b278f1 https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A15ecc5a7-1279-4b82-81c4-394ee1b278f1 https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A15ecc5a7-1279-4b82-81c4-394ee1b278f1/datastream/OBJ/download,http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:15ecc5a7-1279-4b82-81c4-394ee1b278f1,,,2789616072,,0,,0

Codourey; Roland Siegwart,"In micro or nanorobotics, high precision movement in two or more degrees of freedom is one of the main problems. Firstly, the positional precision has to be increased (< 10 nm) as the object sizes decrease. On the other hand, the workspace has to have macroscopic dimensions (1 cm3) to give high maneuverability to the system and to allow suitable handling at the micro/macro-world interface. As basic driving mechanisms for the ETHZ Nanorobot Project, two new piezoelectric devices have been developed. `Abalone' is a 3-dof system that relies on the impact drive principle. The 38 mm X 33 mm X 9 mm slider can be moved to each position and orientation in a horizontal plane within a theoretically infinite workspace. In the stepping mode it achieves a speed of 1 mm/s in translation and 7 deg/s in rotation. Within the actuator's local range of 6 micrometers fine positioning is possible with a resolution better than 10 nm. `NanoCrab' is a bearingless rotational micromotor relying on the stick-slip effect. This 10 mm X 7 mm X 7 mm motor has the advantage of a relatively high torque at low rotational speed and an excellent runout. While the maximum velocity is 60 rpm, it reaches its highest torque of 0.3 mNm at 2 rpm. Another benefit is the powerless holding torque of 0.9 mNm. With a typical step of 0.1 mrad and a local resolution 3 orders of magnitude better than the step angle, NanoCrab can be very precisely adjusted. Design and measurements of the characteristics of these two mechanisms will be presented and compared with the theoretical analysis of inertial drives presented in a companion paper. Finally their integration into the Nanorobot system will be discussed.© (1995) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

However, the robot's electric motor driven actuators usually have a low payload to weight ratio. To overcome this problem and use actuators' power more efficiently, we apply a parallel mechanism to a robot's leg design. A parallel mechanism can distribute a payload over actuators and reduce the actuation torque, and thus enhance the robot's walking stability. The process of optimal design of 3 DOF parallel delta type leg is 1) definition of workspace and payload based on tasks, such as walking and climbing a stair, 2) derivation of inverse kinematics and equation of motion, 3) optimization of a robot leg's mechanism, and finally 4) feasibility of the 3 DOF Parallel Delta type Leg (3PDL) for a quadruped robot compared with the 3 DOF Serial type Leg (3SL).

State-of-the-art actuators, e.g., series elastic actuators, have to compromise bandwidth to improve compliance (i.e., backdrivability). In this article, we describe the design and human–robot interaction modeling of a portable hip exoskeleton based on our custom quasi-direct drive actuation (i.e., a high torque density motor with low ratio gear). We also present a model-based performance benchmark comparison of representative actuators in terms of torque capability, control bandwidth, backdrivability, and force tracking accuracy. This article aims to corroborate the underlying philosophy of “design for control,” namely meticulous robot design can simplify control algorithms while ensuring high performance. Following this idea, we create a lightweight bilateral hip exoskeleton to reduce joint loadings during normal activities, including walking and squatting.

Horst; Richard R. Marcus,"Active orthotic devices require actuators with high torque, a free movement mode, high efficiency, and small size and weight. The FlexCVA is a new type of actuator that addresses these requirements in a unique way. It provides continuously varying torque through the use of two belts alternately deflected by cams. The belts alternate in supplying output torque with one belt pulling the output while the slack is removed from the other belt. The drive ratio is automatically adjusted in response to the load by varying the deflection distance of the belts. The resulting actuator prototype has been demonstrated to supply up to 34 Nm of output torque, and its free movement mode allows it to be backdriven at speeds greater than 400 deg/sec. I. INTRODUCTION HIS paper introduces a new type of actuator, the FlexCVA, which has been developed specifically for use in active orthotics and other applications requiring actuators with characteristics similar to human muscles.

Proceedings of the 2003",,IEEE,,S.E. Lyshevski,"We research cornerstone aspects in the design, modeling, analysis, and optimization of pointing systems. Specifically, the major objectives are encompassed on development of high-performance high-precision pointing systems with surface-mounted piezoelectric (PZT) actuators and MEMS. Pointing systems are flexible, and it is inherently difficult to stabilize and control the flexible modes and guarantee accurate pointing. Therefore, advanced actuation and sensing hardware and design paradigms must be developed and implemented. This paper focuses on the application of the PZT actuators, MEMS and high torque density brushless servomotors to attain the desired objectives. These novel actuators and sensors integrated with high-performance electronics. Performance assessment is performed through high-fidelity modeling, heterogeneous simulations, data-intensive analysis, experiments and characterizations. Robust control algorithms are designed and implemented with the ultimate objective to improve the performance, e.g., efficiency, accuracy, stability, settling time, fast retargeting, etc. Far-reaching multidisciplinary research and multi-objective optimization of interactions between beam-mechanical structures-actuators-sensors-electronics/ICs are performed. It is illustrated that advanced actuators, sensors, ICs and DSPs must be used to achieve the objectives. In particular, PZT actuators and brushless servomotors guarantee high-accuracy fast positioning, rapid retargeting and vibration attenuation. Devising of pointing system (mechanical and electronic design includes actuation and sensing hardware developments, discovery and implementation of novel actuators and sensors, optimization their location and number, integration of actuators-sensors-ICs-DSPs), analysis, modeling, design and optimization are fundamental problems. These problems are addressed and solved.

SMA actuators used in technical applications are parameterized by the use of trial-and-error methods, because there is a lack of computer-aided design tools for this active material. A numerical modeling approach was developed to design and optimize the geometry and the load and heating conditions of SMA actuators in a technical system to achieve a good dynamic and a high reliability. The shape memory effect used in most technical systems is the extrinsic two way effect (2WE). This effect can be simulated with the numerical model which was implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The focus of the model is on the activation behavior of the SMA actuator, which defines its rate of heating and cooling. Different load conditions and various actuator geometries and shapes, e.g. wire or spring actuator, are simulated by the calculation of the energetic balance of the whole system. The numerical model can be used to simulate time variant heating currents in order to obtain an optimal system performance. The model was used to design a rotatory SMA-drive system, which is based on the moving concept of a wave drive gear set. In contrast to the conventional system, which is driven by an electric motor, the SMA drive consists of a strain wave gear and SMA wire actuators that are applied circularly to generate a rotatory movement. Special characteristics of this drive system are a high torque density and a high positioning accuracy.",18,5,686,690,SMA*; Actuator; Electric motor; Materials science; MATLAB; Torque density; Simulation based design; Engineering design process; Simulation; Shape-memory alloy; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11665-009-9424-8 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009JMEP...18..686D/abstract,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11665-009-9424-8,,,2170238179,,0,063-332-151-998-40X; 098-975-728-573-772,6

Ситников; И. В. Миронова,"The current trend in miniaturization of actuators for various electronic devices leads to requirement toughening for dimension and weight parameters of electric Further reduction of the electromagnetic motor volume is no longer possible, therefore, electromechanical transducers, based on the piezoelectric effect come to the fore. Changing the piezoelectric element dimensions when exposed to an electric field (inverse piezoelectric effect) is due to failed symmetrical configuration of the electrical structure of microcrystals of piezo-ceramic material. To transform the changing piezoelectric element dimensions into translational or rotational movement of the movable piezo-motor part are used different designs, for example those using elastically deformed elements or shock-anchoring mechanisms. Using the electrode piezoelectric systems allows us to create ""walking"" type engines, and the piezo-engines in which through the multi-electrode piezo-elements is formed a traveling wave whose energy is converted into rotational motion of the rotor have found wide application in focusing systems of photo- and cine-cameras. Piezoelectric motors have a number of advantages that allow them to compete successfully with other types of electromechanical transducers. These advantages include a high efficiency, high torque retention when there is a lack of the supply voltage, the possibility to obtain low rates and micro-movements without using the mechanical gears, high volume power. However, a difficulty in calculation of the piezoelectric element in this class of motors significantly reduces their workability, resulting in a high percentage of sorting out the piezoelectric elements produced. To calculate the piezoelectric element characteristics such as resonance and anti-resonance frequency, piezoelectric element capacity, total impedance of piezoelectric element can be used an electric model of the electromechanical system. The paper has analyzed various construction diagrams of the piezo-engine, proposed a simple algorithm for calculating the frequency characteristics of the piezoelectric element and has given an example to calculate the plate from the piezo-ceramics of lead zirconate titanate.",16,4,25,40,Piezoelectricity; Piezoelectric accelerometer; Piezoelectric coefficient; Ultrasonic motor; Piezoelectric motor; Piezoelectric sensor; Materials science; Electronic engineering; Acoustics; PMUT; Electromechanical coupling coefficient,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/raschet-harakteristik-piezoelementa-ultrazvukovogo-dvigatelya https://www.radiovega.su/jour/article/download/70/58 http://radiooptics.elpub.ru/jour/article/view/70 https://www.radiovega.su/jour/article/view/70,http://dx.doi.org/10.7463/rdopt.0416.0847731,,10.7463/rdopt.0416.0847731,2530935153,,0,,0

This statically-balanced direct-drive robot has been constructed for stability analysis of the robot in constrained manipulation. As a result of the elimination of the gravity forces (without any counterweights), smaller actuators and consequently smaller amplifiers were chosen. The motors yield acceleration of 5g at the end point without overheating. High torque, low speed, brushless AC synchronous motors are used to power the robot. Graphite epoxy composite material is used for the construction of the robot links. A four-node parallel processor is used to control the robot. The dynamic tracking accuracy with the computed torque method as a control law has been derived experimentally. >",,,442,445,Acceleration; Engineering; Articulated robot; Actuator; Robot calibration; Amplifier; Simulation; Control theory; Synchronous motor; Robot kinematics; Robot,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/12089/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icra/icra1988.html#KazerooniK88,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/robot.1988.12089,,10.1109/robot.1988.12089,2100592639,,0,008-848-470-494-412; 022-034-124-514-067; 040-889-582-993-890; 077-065-853-871-07X; 112-996-383-492-093,29

Secondly, the development of the High-Speed/High-Torque MR actuator is described. Response characteristics of the developed MR actuator are improved by using flat rolled silicon steel sheet.

The German Aerospace Center in Stuttgart, mainly represented by the “energy systems integration” group at the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics intensified its activities since 2007 in this interesting research field.; ; Main topics of the research are the development and optimization of high efficient power generators and complete electrical power trains based on hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, efficient voltage converters and high torque electrical motors.; ; Mainly for the general aviation, an adapted fuel cell system can be used as a power generator unit for the main aircraft propulsion during flight. Therefore the lightweight and the maximized efficiency coupled with an high redundancy and reliability play a major role. Started in 2009 with a “one seater” DLR‐H2 all electric fuel cell driven aircraft, todays development shows the near term feasibility of a “four seater” ‐ “HY4” and the perspective beyond.; ; This oral presentation will give an overview on the feasibility of a hydrogen fuel cell system and hybrid system as power source for aircraft propulsion. The further development of this path includes the system architecture optimization regarding reliability and redundancy. An redundant system architecture will be presented. With this architecture one of the four systems can be removed, maintained and reintroduced during max load current, so the capability of the plane to maintain altitude is not affected.

CubeSats are standardized small size satellites based on 10 × 10 × 10 cm cube modules (1U) and are becoming sophisticated platforms despite their very small size. This paper details the design and the structural analysis of a Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) actuator for agile CubeSats with a physical size up to 12U, which require high torque actuators. CMGs have inherited torque amplification capabilities and the recent advances in motor miniaturization make them ideal candidates for small satellite missions with slew rate requirements. The system’s requirements are derived based on conceptual agility requirements for an agile (highly maneuverable) CubeSat which needs to achieve a 90° maneuver in 90 s. With specific cost, mass and volume requirements, the proposed CMG design is based on some of the smallest available off-the-shelf electric motors and uses a light aluminum casing design. The proposed design uses stepper motors for the gimbal mechanism as a low cost, compact and low power solution, contributing to an overall low mass of the full CMG cluster. Static and dynamic analyses were performed to assess the mechanical integrity of the system for launch loads. Apart from a necessary custom control electronic board, the complete mechanical assembly has been designed including electrical hardware. Analyses demonstrate that the overall stress levels acting on the system are manageable by the CMG design. Bolted joints are critical and should be studied independently as the chosen model created singularities around these areas. Each individual CMG of the designed pyramidal cluster is shown to weigh about 35 g. Using the proposed CMG design with a customized avionics board, the complete CMG system is shown to weigh 250 g and occupies slightly more than ½U volume for a CubeSat, indicating the feasibility of CMGs for agile CubeSats.",7,5,55,,Gimbal; Control moment gyroscope; Torque; Avionics; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Electric motor; CubeSat; Population; Computer science,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/7/5/55/pdf https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/15793 https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/7/5/55/htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/aerospace7050055,,10.3390/aerospace7050055,3023359635,,0,005-787-736-667-478; 010-176-606-292-610; 015-135-224-535-868; 027-414-560-758-849; 060-098-343-532-119; 092-452-318-799-727; 124-990-084-802-571,0

The actuator uses a small hydrostatic transmission to achieve the advantage of large gear reduction from a high speed DC motor, and retains accurate joint torque sensing and control capabilities with no backlash. A disadvantage of the actuator is that is introduces extra dynamics which must be accounted for in robot control systems. It is shown that state feedback enables closed loop control of joint torque, with full back drivability, through an effective gear ratio of 485:1 for the experimental system. The actuator can therefore be used for both position control and output force control, which is essential for modern robot control algorithms.

No.03CH37422),,IEEE,,H. Maekawa; K. Komoriya,"A passively operating load-responsive transmission capable of switching the reduction ration in response to load-torque was developed. When the load torque is low, the transmission operates with a low reduction ratio that enables the actuator to rotate a high-speed and low-torque load efficiently. When the load torque increases, the transmission switches to a high reduction ratio to rotate a low-speed and high-torque load. The reduction ratio is switched by a pair of clutches connected and disconnected separately. These clutches are passively operated by the magnetic mechanism that exerts thrust in alternative direction responding to the load torque without any accessory actuators, sensors, electronics or power supplies. The load-responsive transmission can reduce power, size and weight of the mechanical system and improve its safety since a variant load can be actuated efficiently by a minimal actuator. In this paper, the advantages and requirements of the load-responsive transmission are first outlined followed by the structure and the operation of the developed transmission.

In particular, robotic arms will assist in the detailed visual inspection, instrumented analysis, extraction, and earth return of soil and rock samples. To this end, we are developing new robotic manipulation concepts for use on landers and rovers, wherein mass, volume, power and the ambient Mars environment are significant design constraints. Our earlier work led to MarsArmI, a 2.2 meter, 3-dof hybrid metal/composite, dc-motor actuated arm operating under coordinated joint-space control; NASA's Mars Surveyor '98 mission utilizes this design concept. More recently, we have conceived and implmented new, all- composite, very light robot arms: MarsArmII, a 4.0 kilogram, 2.3 meter arm for lander operations, and MicroArm-1 and MicroArm-2, two smaller 1.0+ kilogram, .7 meter rover arms for mobile sample acquisition and Mars sample return processing. Features of these arms include our creation of new 3D machined composites for critical load-bearing parts; actuation by high-torque density ultrasonic motors; and, visually-designated inverse kinematics positioning with contact force adaptation under a novel task-level, dexterous controls paradigm. Our demonstrated results include robotic trenching, sample grasp-manipulation-and-transfer, and fresh rock surface exposure-probing via the science operator's 'point-and-shoot' visual task designation in a stereo workspace. Sensor-referenced control capabilities include real-time adaptation to positioning error and environmental uncertainties (e.g., variable soil resistance and impediments), and the synthesis of power optimal trajectories for free space manipulation.© (1997) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

However, they cannot provide the torque to completely support everyday movements such as sit to stand [3]. High torques, sometimes sufficient for complete support, are important for people with complete spinal cord injuries, rehabilitation of stiff joints, and protecting workers in dangerous environments from injury. This talk reports the design and preliminary results on a simple high torque actuator, the pleated pneumatic interference actuator (PPIA), that is used in a sit to stand (STS) orthosis (Fig. 1), the soft lifting assistor for the knee (SLAK). PPIAs are based on Nesler et al.’s [4] PIA and made from fabric reinforced rubber bladders. In our previous work [5], the constraints required to laterally stabilize the single PPIA behind the leg limited its range of motion (ROM) well below that required for STS. The 1.35 kg SLAK eliminates the lateral constraints. Instead, it has three parallel PPIAs made of sealed firehose lengths inserted into a 1000D Cordura fabric sleeve. At 320 kPa the SLAK was shown to completely support standing over 94 % of the STS motion (Fig. 2), a very significant improvement over the 67 % of the STS motion of our previous design [5]. The SLAK does so with a torque of 3.8 Nm at 7.9 ° increasing parabolically to 320 Nm at 82 ° knee flexion. When worn, the SLAK generates a torque over the knee’s complete ROM, even providing a torque to support the knee in full extension. However, this is not reflected in the data due to the shifting of the SLAK on the smooth test leg, particularly at low flexion angles. At these angles the significant shear component generated by the PPIA’s torque caused the two ends of the PPIA to move away from each other, misaligning it completely away from the knee joint and preventing it from applying measurable torque. Future work will resolve this problem, and characterize the power and speed performance of the SLAK.",,,1,1,Torque; Actuator; Knee Joint; Stiff joints; Knee flexion; Sit to stand; Full extension; Computer science; Range of motion; Structural engineering,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Fc949cc0a-e20e-4b70-9139-a396fb6ae7a9 https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/slak-completely-supports-sit-to-stand,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Fc949cc0a-e20e-4b70-9139-a396fb6ae7a9,,,3089459642,,0,,0

This effect can then be used to design powerful actuators. The department of electromagnetic engineering has been working with magnetostricitve material and their applications since the 1980s and is presently engaged in a project focusing on magnetostrictive transducer utilisation for the aeronautic field. The focus of the presented work has been to develop and improve methods and tools supporting the development of magnetostrictive actuators. The axial-radial model was previously developed at the department and is well suited for circular cross sections of magnetostrictive rods. It is, however, common to laminate the magnetostrictive rods resulting in rectangular cross sections. The use of Cauer circuits allows modelling of the shielding effect. This shielding effect results in non-homogenous magnetisation and stress in both rectangular and circular cross sections of the rod. A model based on Cauer circuits, including a hysteresis model based on experimental data, was developed during the project. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how figures of merit and the use of finite element methods can be used to find optimised designs in a systematic and computational efficient way. The modified generalised Fabry factor and the magnetisation inhomogeneity coefficient are two proposed new figures of merit. A Magnetostricitve material is characterised through an experimental procedure. Usually, magnetostrictive material exhibit large hysteresis. An important part of the material characterisation is the post-processing of the measurement data, including a de-hysterisation procedure. In the thesis, a de-hysterisation method which ensures energy consistent data is presented. Energy consistent material data is essential to achieve energy consistent simulations of magnetostrictive systems. It is also demonstrated how the knowledge at the department can be utilised in international projects. In an ongoing project, the department is engaged in two sub tasks. In one of these sub tasks a high torque actuator is to be developed for the helicopter industry. The developed magnetostrictive models are used to perform system simulations of such actuator systems. In the other sub task a device for power harvesting from vibrations is analysed. It has now been shown how to adapt the load impedance in order to extract maximal electric power from the device.",,,,,Engineering; Figure of merit; Electronic circuit; Finite element method; Torque; Actuator; Vibration; Transducer; Structural engineering; Magnetostriction; Mechanical engineering,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:12300/FULLTEXT01 http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:12300/FULLTEXT01.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:12300,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:12300,,,2160546758,,0,003-446-433-210-421; 009-904-447-048-22X; 015-090-869-770-906; 019-614-966-034-468; 021-900-537-208-123; 036-301-706-556-680; 041-049-071-983-820; 044-872-362-113-120; 045-817-877-726-035; 066-227-065-921-099; 067-385-728-974-870; 072-020-440-036-286; 073-779-827-947-316; 078-103-055-877-072; 085-619-733-625-458; 089-048-201-738-004; 119-934-218-765-693; 147-812-520-137-209; 154-296-636-180-896; 177-016-355-741-672; 185-893-406-973-065; 188-644-674-996-556,0

International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics : [proceedings],19457901; 19457898,,United States,Marta Moltedo; Tomislav Bacek; Kevin Langlois; Karen Junius; Bram Vanderborght; Dirk Lefeber,"The human ankle joint plays a crucial role during walking. At the push-off phase the ankle plantarflexors generate the highest torque among the lower limb joints during this activity. The potential of the ankle plantarflexors is affected by numerous pathologies and injuries, which cause a decrease in the ability of the subject to achieve a natural gait pattern. Active orthoses have shown to have potential in assisting these subjects. The design of such robots is very challenging due to the contrasting design requirements of wearability (light weight and compact) and high torques capacity. This paper presents the development of a high-torque ankle actuator to assist the ankle joint in both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The compliant actuator is a spindle-driven MACCEPA (Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable Equilibrium Position Actuator). The design of the actuator was made to keep its weight as low as possible, while being able to provide high torques. As a result of this novel design, the actuator weighs 1.18kg.

We propose the use of CMGs in actuating joint degrees of freedom in a spacecraft-mounted agile imaging payload, whose tasks include acquiring and tracking a high-speed target. High agility, on the order of several radians per second, characterizes the system of interest here; however, such capabilities are achieved with traditional actuators only at the expense of excessively high electrical power. The proposed design provides agile slewing of an imaging payload for a very small fraction of the power required by fixed rotors in a reaction wheel assembly.

115-458-638-218-258,Optimierung eines piezoelektrisch erregten linearen Wanderwellenmotors,,2006,dissertation,,,,,Jens Haug,"In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden verschiedene Optimierungsmoglichkeiten und ; -methoden am Beispiel eines linearen Wanderwellenmotors angewandt. Im Vordergrund des Interesses stand dabei nicht unbedingt, nur diese eine Bauform eines Wanderwellenmotors in ihrer Entwicklung voran zu treiben, sondern fur viele vergleichbare Motoren hilfreiche Techniken zu erarbeiten. Die meisten der beschriebenen Optimierungen sind daher auf andere, auch auf rotatorische Wanderwellenmotoren ubertragbar, manche sind auch fur sonstige Piezoantriebe; nutzlich. Als Ausgangspunkt diente ein bereits vorhandenes Labormuster eines linearen Wanderwellenmotors. Hierauf aufbauend wurde ein praxisnaher Prototyp entworfen, z. T. simuliert, aufgebaut und getestet. Der Systemgedanke spielte eine grose Rolle in dieser Arbeit. Ein Piezomotor als mechanische Einheit ist an sich noch nicht ohne weiteres nutzbar, da fur Wanderwellenmotoren leider keine Standard-Ansteuerungen verfugbar sind. Fur einen Einsatz als Positionierantrieb sind daruber hinaus auch Fragen der Anbindung an ubergeordnete Rechnersysteme, der Integration von Wegmesssystemen usw. relevant. Insgesamt ergaben sich hieraus Aufgaben aus den Bereichen Software, analoge und digitale Signalverarbeitung, Leistungselektronik, Filterung von Leistungssignalen, Gestaltung von resonanten piezoelektrischen Wandlern und mechanischen Schwingern, reibschlussige Kraftubertragung bis hin zum spielfreien und steifen Bewegungsabgriff. Der verwendete Microcontroller ist in seiner Leistungsfahigkeit fur den Zweck der Signalerzeugung und die Anbindung an ubergeordnete Rechnersysteme bzw. an eine Benutzerschnittstellen gerade ausreichend. Mit Hilfe peripherer Elektronik kann er Messwerte von ausgegebener Spannung und aufgenommenem Strom aus der Leistungs-Endstufe verarbeiten und hieraus die geeignete Arbeitsfrequenz fur den Motor ableiten. Die vom Microcontroller ausgegebenen Signale zur Ansteuerung der Piezokeramik werden von einer relativ konventionellen schaltenden Endstufe auf rund 50 V verstarkt. Diese Leistungssignale werden gefiltert, indem eine zusatzliche Induktivitat, eine zusatzliche Kapazitat, ein Ubertrager (1:5) und die Kapazitat der Piezokeramik einen Bandpass bilden. Dieser Bandpass ist sehr unempfindlich gegenuber Anderungen der Arbeitsfrequenz und gegenuber Drift der Bauteilwerte. Durch die primarseitige Anbringung der zusatzlichen Filterbauteile ergeben sich verringerte Verluste im Ubertrager. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Wanderwellenmotoren sind die Piezokeramik-Elemente nicht in halben, sondern in viertel Wellenlangen strukturiert. Durch diese Labda/4-Segmentierung und eine Anbringung auf beiden Seiten des Aluminiums im Anregungsbereich erhohen sich die erreichbaren Schwingungsamplituden um mehr als Faktor 3 auf rund 7 µm. Bei derart starken Schwingungen sind allerdings manuell angebrachte Lotstellen auf der Piezokeramik am Prototypen nicht dauerhaft haltbar, weshalb eher verhalten angesteuert bzw. eine stark verkurzte Lebensdauer hingenommen werden musste. Als Leitermaterial kam aus dem gleichen Grund Federbronze (CuSn6 nach DIN EN 12166) zur Anwendung. Durch verbesserte FEM-Modelle gelang es, eine bessere Ubereinstimmung zwischen Simulation und Realitat zu erzielen. Die verwendeten orthogonalen Moden von fruher 190 Hz Differenz wurden auf nur noch 50 Hz aneinander angenahert. Der Laufer des wurde ebenfalls in FEM-Simulationen optimiert. Einer gleichmasigen Verteilung der Anpresskraft unter dem Reibbelag ist hinsichtlich des Abtriebsverhaltens besondere Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken. Hierdurch und durch die Wahl eines geeigneten Reibbelages konnte die Anpresskraft und damit die erreichbare Vorschubkraft deutlich gesteigert werden, ohne schadliche Nebeneffekte wie Gerauschentwicklung oder ungleichmasigen Lauf hinnehmen zu; mussen. Auch die Steifigkeit in Vorschubrichtung bei gleichzeitig moglichst leichter Bauweise war Teil der Optimierung. Die im Betrieb zu erwartenden Deformationen des Lauferrahmens liegen daher unter nur 5 µm. Trotzdem konnte die bewegte Masse von rund 45 g auf 35 g reduziert werden. Insgesamt wurde die Haltekraft im unbestromten Zustand von unter 4 N auf 14 N mehr als verdreifacht. Die Blockierkraft stieg von 3,7 N auf 6,7 N um uber 80 %. War fruher die Beschleunigung stets bei rund 6 g, so trifft dieser Wert nun nur noch fur das Anfahren aus dem unbestromten Stillstand zu, da hier prinzipbedingt erst ein Einschwingen des Stators stattfinden muss. Bei Fahrtrichtungswechsel dagegen verzogert der optimierte Prototyp zunachst mit 20 g und beschleunigt anschliesend mit 11 g in Gegenrichtung. Dies entspricht ebenfalls einer Verdreifachung bzw. einer knappen Verdoppelung der vorherigen Werte. Mit einer Zusatzmasse von 100 g belastet verbleiben noch 7 g gegenuber vorher unter 2 g, also auch hier uber dreifache Steigerung. Die Leerlaufgeschwindigkeit wurde von fruher 630 mm/s um 11 % auf jetzt 700 mm/s gesteigert. ; Different types of piezo motors have been presented during the last decades. Unlike simple piezo actuators they provide a very lange stroke or unlimited rotary angles (respectively). Several commercially available rotary motors based on the travelling wave priciple are on the market today, e. g. in autofocus lenses by Canon, Nikon and others. They show high torque per volume, high holding torque without any current applied and very short time constants. In these travelling wave motors, two orthogonal standing waves at the same resonance frequency are superimposed to form a travelling wave in a stator ring. They can be excited by a thin piezo ceramic which is glued to this stator ring. The piezo ceramic normally consists of two seperately plated active areas, one for each mode. The polarization of each active area alters every half wave length so that a corresponding wave is excited when applying a voltage to it. With a bending wave travelling through a structure, points at the surface move on elliptical trajectories. When a rotor or slider is pressed to the surface, it only has high friction contact to those points which are currently displaced to a maximum and which all move into the same direction, so it is driven forward by friction contact to these points. A pure travelling wave requires the orthogonal standing waves to have a phase shift of 90° to each other. Therefor, the electronic cirquit needs two channels which apply the appropriate voltages at the right phase angle and in the resonance frequency to the active piezo areas. The principle of the well known rotary travelling wave motors can also be applied to linear motors. A first sample has been designed and tested before. This theses is about the optimization of the piezoelectrically excited linear travelling wave motor. Since a travelling wave motor is a mechatronic system with interaction between electronic signals, electrical behaviour, mechanical vibrations, friction contact and mechanical periphery, it is very important to optimize the complete system and not only parts of it. Progress has been achieved in all components: ; - A low cost micro controller is used to produce two signals at the appropriate working frequency and phase angle, measuring the applied voltages and currents on the piezos as feedback. As the frequency resolution of the PWM modules is not satisfying, a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) is used for the processor clock. Useful features like control of limit switches, a numerical display and a keyblock as a simple user interface have been added. ; - Simple LC filters are too sensitive to frequency variations due to temperature drifts of the mechanical resonance frequencies. Therefor, one coil, one transformer, one capacitor and the piezo ceramic itself are used as LLCC filter to suppress the higher freqencies of the switching power amplifier s square signals. ; - In contrast to other travelling wave motors, the piezo ceramic is polarized evenly and con-tacted in segments of a quarter wavelength. This almost doubles the quantity of the effective active material. Piezo ceramic is glued to both sides of the appropriate stator region, again doubling the active material. In total, the possible amplitude of vibration was increased by more than a factor of three to values around 7 mm/s.; In total, significant improvements have been achieved for all components of the drive system. The methods can be applied to different other piezo motors as well.",,,,,Analytical chemistry; Electrical engineering; Physics; High torque; Frequency resolution; Switching power; Traveling wave; Half wave,,,,,http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/4090,http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/4090,,,2130603626,,0,,0

No.03CH37453),,IEEE,,Hiroshi Kawano; T. Hirahara,"A multi degree of freedom (multi-DOF) ultrasonic motor is anticipated as an actuator in the next generation, because it can drive three-DOF motion with high torque and low noise that can not be perceived by the human auditory system. Using a multi-DOF ultrasonic motor as an actuator that constitutes the mechanism of the neck of the auditory tele-existence robot ""TeleHead"" is a good example of its applicability. However getting enough torque requires a suitable pre-loading method, and properly controlling three-DOF motion requires a suitable measurement method of the three-DOF angular position of the rotor and a control algorithm that takes into account the high-DOF motion and complex physical characteristics of the motor. This paper proposes both a hardware system for pre-loading and measuring 3-DOF angular position and a software system for controlling 3-DOF motion of the motor from the view point of application to TeleHead (see video). The proposed pre-loading method can generate enough pre-loading force and reduce resistance torque when the dummy head of ""TeleHead"" is in the inclined state. The proposed measuring method for three-DOF motion achieves a wide range of angular position of the motion of the dummy head in each rotating direction, especially in the yaw direction. The proposed control algorithm adopts a serial switching method with a very high frequency, and does not need any dynamics model of the physical characteristics of the motor for control signal calculation. Experimental results show the high performance of the proposed system when a 1-kg load is attached to the rotor of the multi-DOF ultrasonic motor.",,,2247,2253,Angular displacement; Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Torque; Software system; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Machine control; Simulation; Control theory; Robot,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2003.1249205 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249205/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iros/iros2003.html#KawanoH03 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1249205/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iros.2003.1249205,,10.1109/iros.2003.1249205,2125737005,,0,006-951-085-337-747; 008-234-944-186-379; 021-482-850-275-374; 044-496-597-207-088; 084-654-788-019-700,7

Small electric motors, which are more efficient at high speeds and low torques, do not fit the requirements directly. In order to transform the motor characteristics into the desired output characteristics, a transmission system is needed. Ideally, it should be optimally designed and adapted to the desired characteristics and the available space. Scaling laws can provide a way to design these desired output requirements as a function of the size parameters. These are however not yet available for transmission systems. To fill this gap, several scaling laws are developed throughout this paper for some of the most important robotic characteristics, i.e. maximum continuous output torque and reflected inertia, in function of the number of stages, the transmission ratio and the size parameters of different types of transmissions. These laws show that diameter has a much bigger influence on the characteristics of transmissions than length. All derived laws show good comparison with catalog data of manufacturers like Maxon, Moog, Neugart, Harmonic Drive®, Sumitomo and SKF.",140,,601,621,Inertia; Transmission system; Harmonic; Torque; Actuator; Electric motor; Moog; Scaling law; Computer science; Control theory,,,,European Research Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X19301739,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2019.06.027,,10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2019.06.027,2955010755,,0,004-889-081-570-501; 009-387-121-815-975; 014-158-207-089-101; 022-259-729-539-90X; 025-978-537-443-671; 028-172-100-771-230; 029-338-646-499-172; 036-636-988-611-717; 037-185-483-971-377; 039-430-402-546-977; 041-137-104-090-624; 049-477-830-903-337; 064-292-581-075-149; 064-374-437-683-624; 070-017-903-151-062; 073-728-088-093-803; 093-996-637-417-441; 096-295-550-113-143; 105-305-815-017-423; 110-573-567-224-563; 121-062-734-450-07X; 124-191-954-658-139; 125-817-874-684-87X; 138-563-537-445-944; 141-121-514-693-873; 154-317-762-395-580; 158-760-804-109-266; 158-880-813-786-986,2

Otten; Jeffrey H. Lang; Sangbae Kim,"This paper presents the design principles for highly efficient legged robots, the implementation of the principles in the design of the MIT Cheetah, and the analysis of the high-speed trotting experimental results. The design principles were derived by analyzing three major energy-loss mechanisms in locomotion: heat losses from the actuators, friction losses in transmission, and the interaction losses caused by the interface between the system and the environment. Four design principles that minimize these losses are discussed: employment of high torque-density motors, energy regenerative electronic system, low loss transmission, and a low leg inertia. These principles were implemented in the design of the MIT Cheetah; the major design features are large gap diameter motors, regenerative electric motor drivers, single-stage low gear transmission, dual coaxial motors with composite legs, and the differential actuated spine. The experimental results of fast trotting are presented; the 33-kg robot runs at 22 km/h (6 m/s). The total power consumption from the battery pack was 973 W and resulted in a total cost of transport of 0.5, which rivals running animals' at the same scale. 76% of the total energy consumption is attributed to heat loss from the motor, and the remaining 24% is used in mechanical work, which is dissipated as interaction loss as well as friction losses at the joint and transmission.",20,3,1117,1129,Inertia; Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Electric motor; Work (physics); Efficient energy use; Battery pack; Simulation; Robot,,,,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/108096 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/518442 https://xplqa30.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=6880316 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6880316 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83225552.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2014.2339013,,10.1109/tmech.2014.2339013,2159220301,,0,000-780-854-694-801; 001-522-678-734-564; 009-499-920-057-927; 014-061-255-640-85X; 020-376-215-974-031; 021-782-144-670-232; 023-695-429-703-605; 033-649-731-036-001; 033-680-805-621-787; 036-307-656-036-480; 039-188-483-752-381; 040-619-234-286-524; 046-246-412-162-364; 049-341-502-829-702; 057-823-262-888-798; 057-840-310-845-296; 060-015-331-149-589; 061-117-295-135-801; 062-881-920-045-52X; 067-522-209-101-988; 082-628-786-123-027; 084-457-997-147-044; 084-464-151-729-644; 091-419-861-396-03X; 093-952-271-919-361; 096-337-651-080-777; 099-204-269-641-297; 104-041-533-583-344; 105-100-876-813-280; 105-641-136-083-413; 108-141-241-164-766; 114-765-129-719-592; 120-849-882-277-494; 124-093-313-744-791; 130-556-749-524-613; 142-844-901-236-491; 145-131-392-960-930,198

They represent a new actuator generation in the field of servo-drives. In particular, the travelling wave ultrasonic motor presents a high torque at low speed, a zero speed torque without feeding, low sensitivity to electromagnetic disturbances as well as being a more compact solution if compared to conventional electromagnetic motors. Much researches has been performed by others to determine an analytical model based on the identification of an electromagnetic equivalent circuit or on exploitation of a theoretical model based on numerical approaches, which use finite elements methods. While leading to satisfactory analysis, these modeling methods can hardly be exploited in the design of control algorithms. Indeed, they require considerable processing resources to generate and visualize the results. For this reason, we introduce in this thesis, an analytical model that is easily adaptable to operational applications and control techniques. The proposed analytical model has been validated by comparing measured characteristics with those obtained in simulations, which was possible thanks to the realization of a modular test bench. The travelling wave ultrasonic motor is characterized by strong non-linearity. It also depends highly on the wear state of the materials, which is difficult to model, and on the contact surface between stator and rotor. In addition, the mechanical resonance frequency experiences drift due to the variations of temperature. These considerations of strong non-linearities and parameter sensitivities of the motor represent a challenge for the study and design of an efficient and robust control strategy. We introduce with this thesis a new control approach that guarantees a closed loop response which is independent of the motor operating point. Moreover, the proposed control method allows to avoid the discontinuities typically present with this type of actuator with a very reasonnable hardware requierments. Finally, an important extension in the product range of the piezoelectric actuators is proposed in the last part of this thesis. It acts to develop an fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) compatible haptic interface with one degree of freedom. The use of a robotic interface in conjunction with an fMRI environment would enable neuroscientists to investigate the brain mechanism used to perform tasks with arbitrary dynamics, and could become a critical tool in neuroscience and rehabilitaiton. There is, however, a major problem for robot working within an fMRI environment : conventional actuators and materials interfere with the strong permanent magnetic field and the fast switching magnetic field gradients. Consequently, non-ferromagnetic materials must be used to avoid forces on the device itself, that can compromise its performance and may result in hazardous conditions for the patient or the medical staff. In addition, the materials should be non-conducting to avoid the generation of eddy currents. The travelling wave ultrasonic motor was used because it provides benefits compared to the conventional electromagnetic actuators. Non-ferromagnetic piezoelectric ceramic material is used and as a result motor operation is not affected by the presence of the strong magnetic fields ecountered in the clinical scanners.",,,,,Engineering; Control engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Torque; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Operating point; Test bench; Stator; Robust control,,,,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/53671,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/53671,,,1695309893,,0,,1

With this aim in mind, and based on reported user needs, we targeted two main aspects of contemporary active prosthetics: sensing and actuation.; ; The restoration of proprioceptive capabilities through the artificial limb is vital for their intuitive and precise control. In order to capture the prosthetics position, we designed extremely soft microfluidic sensors using conductive liquids such as eutectic Gallium Indium (eGaIn) or Room Temperature Ionic Liquid (RTIL) embedded in soft elastomers. These sensors were used first to sense unidirectional strain, then normal force through Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in a soft microfluidic skin, and were finally embedded in a soft artificial skin that was used to measure the human hand motion.; ; Conventional electromagnetic actuators are poorly suited for prosthetic actuation. Grasping tasks typically require large torque at low speeds whereas conventional actuators are designed to be efficient at high rotational speeds. In consequence, we designed the ""Programmable Permanent Magnet"" (PPM) actuator. This unique actuator, based on the magnetization of permanent magnets by current pulses, is able to maintain a large torque at no speed and for no energetic cost.

Although a variety of passive brakes have been developed in order to safely regulate joint velocities, their performances are significantly subjective to gravity direction and mounting position, and thus are not suitable for multi-degrees of freedom (DoF) robotic applications. Addressing these issues, we developed a centrifugal force-based configuration-independent high-torque-density passive brake. The brake is rapidly and bidirectionally activated at the desired velocity limit in any orientation relative to the direction of gravity.

The introduction of permanent magnets based on rare earth, experienced since the 1960's, gave a great input in the development of innovative machine topologies. On the other hand, the increase and the instability of rare earth PMs price, especially between 2010 and 2013, have directed the research of rare earth free alternatives, or machines using a smaller amount of PMs.; Actually, the current trend in the industrial and academic research focused on developing high performance electric motors and generators, among different electrical machines, highlights the Synchronous Reluctance (SynRel) and the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Reluctance (PMASynRel) motors as best candidates to satisfy the future energy and efficiency requirements.; This thesis is comprehensively dedicated to theoretical and experimental analysis and design of the Synchronous Reluctance (SynRel) and the Permanent Magnet Assisted Synchronous Reluctance (PMASynRel) machines. In particular, it will be focused on electrical machines which power ratings are ranging from fraction of Watts to some hundred kWatts, for vehicular traction and house-hold appliances.; SynRel and PMASynRel motors exhibit many technical advantages, like simple and robust structure, high torque density, high efficiency, small space required for PMs, high degrees of freedom in the design, high operating speed range, high overload capability, low back EMF (null in case of SynRel motors), leading to a safe behavior in case of inverter failure. Furthermore, thanks to the appropriate vector control algorithm, the performance in terms of efficiency and torque become highly competitive.; The subject matter covered in the thesis is organized into three Parts, each including a certain number of chapters.; % At the beginning of each Part, a brief summary is proposed aiming to describe the main content of that Part, the goals and the anticipation of the main results.; Part I includes seven chapters summarizing the research activities carried out during the Ph.D. period. The first six chapters are dedicated to electrical machines for vehicular traction, while chapter 7 investigate on motors for house-hold appliances.; Chapter 1 is mainly introductory and meant to provide the basics information to understand which are the pros and cons and the features of the machines under study. ; Chapter 2 summarize the design criteria and the electrical requirements of ferrite PMASynRel machine for traction application. The electromechanical performance have been evaluated and compared, in terms of torque and power. A brief description of the electric supply system in order to accurately and efficiently manage the motor for achieving the requested performance is presented.; Chapter 3 highlights the influence and benefits of using ferrite magnets on the machine performance, emphasizing the importance of a careful evaluation of the magnet volume in order to increase the performance while reducing the used quantity. ; Chapter 4 is devoted to the sensitivity analysis of the machine performance in terms of torque ripple with respect to the geometrical design. An optimization algorithm has been performed in order to investigate and determine a rotor geometry which maximize the torque and reduces the torque ripple. The impact of the geometrical parameters is taken into account and the sensitivity of the optimal solution to the geometry variation is pointed out.; This chapter highlights the difficulty to get a robust geometry as far as the torque ripple reduction is concerned. Finally, a few experimental results on a Synchronous Reluctance motor prototype will be presented, compared with Finite Element Analysis simulations for validation.; Chapter 5 deals with the design and optimization of a high speed PMASynRel motor considering the driving cycles of an electric vehicle. A procedure is employed to evaluate the most effective design area, which has to be considered for the global optimization. Both results and advantages of the adopted methodology are highlighted.; Further analysis on traction machines are going to be presented in Chapter 6. A comparison between ferrite and sintered NdFeB PMASynRel, SynRel and a Surface mounted PM (SPM) machines performance is deeply investigated.; Chapter 7, the last of this first part, will highlight the advantages in using SynRel and PMASynRel motors for house-hold appliances. The main purpose of this chapter is to discuss the features of these motors as a valid substitute to commercial motors actually used for washing machines application.; Part II is dedicated to the analytical modeling of SynRel machines with the challenge of predicting accurately the air-gap field of the machine taking into account the effect of the rotor flux barriers. This Part is divided into two chapters.; Chapter 8 explains the hypothesis on which the analytical model is based, the calculation of stator Magneto Motive Force through winding function and describes the reluctance network equivalent circuit for a SynRel motor with one and two flux barriers per pole. The computation of the parameters of the model, the air-gap flux density and finally some comparison with Finite Element Analysis are presented.; In Chapter 9 SynRel motors with split-phase stator winding sets supplied by multiple inverters have been investigated as an increasingly attractive solution for fault-tolerant, rugged, magnet-free vehicle traction drives. As an extension to the previous chapter, an analytical procedure to model and simulate a SynRel motor, with a split-phase stator winding, through a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) technique, has been introduced. As an output, the air-gap flux density of the SynRel motor can be computed at any operating point.; Part III, finally, presents some experimental measurements carried out for two prototypes of SynRel and PMASynRel machines, with the purpose of comparing the results achieved in the motor optimization presented in Chapter 7.",,,,,Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Vector control; Rotor (electric); Electric motor; Magnetic reluctance; Electric vehicle; Stator; Torque ripple,,,,,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/7987/,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/7987/,,,2280335223,,0,,1

More compact and simpler haptic gloves would greatly increase our ability to interact with virtual worlds in a more natural way. This research explored the design of a compact force feedback glove using a new finger mechanism and magnetorheological (MR) brakes as passive actuators that oppose human finger motion. The mechanism allowed for a reduction of the number of actuators and application of distributed forces at the bottom surface of user's fingers when an object was grasped in a virtual environment. The MR brakes incorporated a serpentine flux path that led to a small brake with high torque output and the elimination of remote actuation. Force analysis of the mechanism, grasping force experiments, and virtual pick-and-place experiments were done.

Most of the handful of successful humanoid robots in this size class that exist today utilize harmonic drives for gear reduction to gain high torque in a compact package. However, this makes the cost of such a robot too high and thus puts it out of reach of most of those who want to use it for general research, education and outreach activities. Besides the cost, the heavy weight of the robot also causes difficulties in handling and raises concerns for safety. In this paper we present the design of a new class of full-sized bipedal humanoid robots that is lightweight and low cost. This is achieved by utilizing spring assisted parallel four-bar linkages with synchronized actuation in the lower body to reduce the torque requirements of the individual actuators which also enables the use of off the shelf components to further reduce the cost significantly. The resulting savings in weight not only makes the operation of the robot safer, but also allows it to forgo the expensive force/torque sensors at the ankles and achieve stable bipedal walking only using the feedback from the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit.) CHARLI-L (Cognitive Humanoid Autonomous Robot with Learning Intelligence - Lightweight) is developed using this approach and successfully demonstrated untethered bipedal locomotion using ZMP (Zero Moment Point) based control, stable omnidirectional gaits, and carrying out tasks autonomously using vision based localization.Copyright © 2011 by ASME",,,799,806,Engineering; Control engineering; Torque; Actuator; Zero moment point; Autonomous robot; Simulation; Humanoid robot; Robot control; Inertial measurement unit; Robot,,,,,https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1640997 http://www.romela.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Development-of-a-full-sized-bipedal-humanoid-robot-utilizing-spring-assisted-parallel-four-bar-linkages-with-synchronized-actuation.pdf https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings/IDETC-CIE2011/54839/799/354420 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1640997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/detc2011-48412,,10.1115/detc2011-48412,2044050972,,0,027-949-752-604-036; 030-155-406-001-13X; 037-574-098-588-805; 037-948-198-194-196; 046-155-854-266-925; 063-082-955-464-666; 063-253-813-884-626; 109-039-735-971-504; 148-278-842-508-93X,3

It enables actuation and locomotion of tethered and untethered objects without the need for a local power supply. In clinical applications, it is used for active steering of catheters in medical interventions such as cardiac ablation for arrhythmia treatment and for steering of camera pills in the gastro-intestinal tract for diagnostic video acquisition. For these applications, specialized clinical-scale field applicators have been developed, which are rather limited in terms of field strength and flexibility of field application. For a general-purpose field applicator, flexible field generation is required at high field strengths as well as high field gradients to enable the generation of both torques and forces on magnetic devices. To date, this requirement has only been met by small-scale experimental systems. We have built a highly versatile clinical-scale field applicator that enables the generation of strong magnetic fields as well as strong field gradients over a large workspace.

This is due to the need of high torque and power density in such engineering applications. Despite these advantages, hydraulic actuators are fabricated from metallic materials, which provoke their heavy weight, which necessitate the development of a lightweight hydraulic actuator, fabricated of composite materials. Using composite materials in hydraulic cylinders, it is important to study the friction force characteristics and to estimate the friction coefficient between composites and O-rings, which is presented in this paper. This paper deals with the estimation of Coulomb friction and friction coefficient in the lightweight hydraulic cylinder fabricated mainly of composite materials. The actuator is presented by its dynamic equation of motion, where each term is discussed including the stiffness coefficient, the viscous damping coefficient, the kinematics and the pressure parameters. Meanwhile, these coefficients and parameters are obtained according to data recorded from conducted experiments. As a result, the new methodology which uses the experimental measurements combined the dynamic model has succeeded to evaluate the friction inside the hydraulic cylinder which has been estimated and found to be around 166[Formula: see text]N, while the corresponding coefficient of friction is computed (about 0.61 as average value).

Indirect drive systems, unlike direct drive systems, use gear transmission mechanisms in the chain of links and actuator for the purpose of speed reduction and torque amplification. As a result, they are widely used in applications that require high torque capacity such as robotic applications. The gear transmission mechanisms, however, introduce compliance and nonlinear properties such as friction and hysteresis to the system. Moreover, when robots are driven at high speeds to increase productivity and quality, oscillations on the end-effector often occur caused by the transmission mechanism. Thus, the use of gear mechanisms brings great challenges to the design of servo control systems for robot manipulators that requires high precision at high speed.To enhance the performance of servo control systems for robot manipulators, this dissertation first presents a tuning method that automatically finds the servo gains of fixed structure controllers for a specified trajectory. The current practice is to tune the controller gains manually, which is a time-consuming task even for experienced control engineers. An automated gain tuning process saves not only time but also the labor cost. The tuning method presented in this dissertation finds the optimal controller gains using real-time nonlinear programming. The controller gains are tuned and the effectiveness of the tuning method is demonstrated by experiments. The dissertation then presents an adaptive disturbance cancellation scheme to reduce the oscillations caused by the transmission error from speed reducers. To enhance performance of the adaptive scheme while maintaining a good transient response, two modifications are introduced to the basic compensation structure. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the improvement in load side performance.Robots often perform the same task repeatedly in industrial applications and thus the tracking error becomes repetitive from one run to another. Iterative learning control is a practical and promising method that reduces the error which repeats in every cycle. An optimization-based iterative learning controller design for the purpose of disturbance rejection is proposed in the third part of this dissertation. It is a model-based design method, where the trade-off between performance and robustness can be handled. Two iterative learning controllers based on different sensor information are designed and compared. Due to the lack of load side position measurements, a load side position estimation algorithm based on Kalman filtering is proposed. The experimental results are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the estimation scheme and the benefits of applying learning controllers for rejecting load side vibrations.Experiments of the research issues mentioned above are performed on a single axis test stand. As the first step to generalize the control algorithms developed in this dissertation to actual multi-degree-of-freedom robots, system identification of the FANUC M-16iB robot is presented in the last part of this dissertation.",,,,,Servo; Iterative learning control; System identification; Engineering; Control engineering; Motion control; Servo control; Control theory; Control theory; Robot end effector; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xd2534b.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xd2534b?view=search https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xd2534b,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xd2534b,,,163278132,,0,,0

Pristaylo; O. B. Pochka,"In order to increase the reliability and durability of a roller forming unit, we calculated a combined mode of the reciprocating movement of a forming trolley with the reversal according to the fourth-order acceleration with the optimal values of boundary accelerations. In determining the combined mode of the reciprocating movement of the forming trolley with the reversal according to the fourth-order acceleration with the optimal values of boundary accelerations, the criterion of the movement was the criteria action, which is a time integral with the integrand function expressing the ""energy"" of the unit fourth-order accelerations. We calculated the functions of changing the kinematic characteristics of the forming trolley moving from one extreme position to another, with the functions corresponding to the combined mode of the reciprocating movement of the forming trolley with the reversal according to the fourth-order acceleration with the optimal values of boundary accelerations. It is proposed that the design use a drive in the form of a cam mechanism, for which we constructed a cam profile to provide for the combined mode of the reciprocating movement of the forming trolley with the reversal according to the fourth-order acceleration with the optimal values of boundary accelerations. It is also proposed that the roller forming unit design use a drive from a high-torque stepper motor embedded into the compaction rollers of the forming trolley. The use of the specified drive mechanism in the unit leads to a reduction in the dynamic loads in the drive mechanism elements and, accordingly, to an increase in the reliability and durability of the unit as a whole. The results of the work may further be useful for refining and improving the existing engineering methods for calculating the drive mechanisms of roller forming machines both at the design stages and in real operation modes.

In addition, if one needs to do mechanical work outside a structure, electrical feedthroughs are required to transport the electric power to drive the motor. In this paper, we present designs for driving rotary and linear motors by pumping stress waves across a structure or barrier. We accomplish this by designing a piezoelectric actuator on one side of the structure and a resonance structure that is matched to the piezoelectric resonance of the actuator on the other side. Typically, piezoelectric motors can be designed with high torques and lower speeds without the need for gears. One can also use other actuation materials such as electrostrictive, or magnetostrictive materials in a benign environment and transmit the power in acoustic form as a stress wave and actuate mechanisms that are external to the benign environment. This technology removes the need to perforate a structure and allows work to be done directly on the other side of a structure without the use of electrical feedthroughs, which can weaken the structure, pipe, or vessel. Acoustic energy is pumped as a stress wave at a set frequency or range of frequencies to produce rotary or linear motion in a structure. This method of transferring useful mechanical work across solid barriers by pumping acoustic energy through a resonant structure features the ability to transfer work (rotary or linear motion) across pressure or thermal barriers, or in a sterile environment, without generating contaminants. Reflectors in the wall of barriers can be designed to enhance the efficiency of the energy/power transmission.

The motor design has the advantage of a macro and micro stepper motor with high torque and speed. The design is capable of fast angular positioning with micro level accuracy.

The motor consists of a torsional section that provides angular displacement and torque, and two alternating clamping sections which provide the holding force. The motor relies on the principal piezoelectric coupling coefficient (d33) without torsional piezoelectric elements. This design eliminates bending moment and shear applied to the actuator elements and thus increases its torque capability.

In the previous study, the authors proposed a new type USM using bending vibration mode. In that new design, elliptical trajectory vibrations are formed on the two driving feet by composing two orthogonal bending vibration modes of a piezoelectric-metal beam, that avoid the mode degeneration problem in the design process. In this paper, our research focuses on the exciting mode of bending vibration ceramics of the proposed motor. Firstly, the vibration characteristics of the proposed motor under different exciting modes by changing the imposed position of the electrode are obtained by transient analysis. Then, the exciting mode is adjusted by changing the imposed area of the electrode, and the vibration strengths of the driving feet are analyzed. Analysis results show that the PZT ceramic away from the neutral plane of the bending mode shape offers more contributions to the bending vibration of the motor under the same exciting voltage, while the PZT ceramic that near to the neutral plane give very few contribution.

Torque control using an ultrasonic motor and a low rigidity spring has drawn attention as a possible solution. However, the mechanical resonance of the spring and the windup phenomenon caused by angular velocity saturation can degrade the control performance. Therefore, in this paper, feedback of the motor side angle and the load side angle is implemented to compensate for mechanical resonance. Moreover, a limit error feedback method is applied to compensate for angular velocity saturation. In the proposed control method, the frequency response is adjusted and stability is increased and the effects are analytically validated.

In order to address the limited control performance which prevents PAMs from being more widely used, a hybrid actuation scheme has been proposed to combine PAMs and a low inertia DC motor, and presented significantly improved control performance without loss of robot safety.While the DC motor provides high precision and reliability, the small motor has, however, difficulties in dealing with the large stored energies of the PAMs, especially in the events of PAMs failure and large initial load changes. In order to further ensure robot safety, we developed a new hybrid actuation scheme with PAMs (macro) and a particle brake (mini), which provides high torque-toweight ratio and inherent stability.We then conducted comparative studies between hybrid actuations with (1) a DC motor and (2) a brake in terms of robot safety and performance. Experimental comparisons show that the hybrid actuation with PAMs and a brake provides higher energy efficiency for control bandwidths under 2 Hz, and is capable of effectively reducing large impacts due to the brake’s high torque capacity and passive energy dissipation. These comparative studies provide insight that the hybrid actuation with PAMs and a brake can be a competitive solution for the applications that require high efficiency, but accept a relatively low control performance, for example, a waist joint.",,,101,111,Inertia; Dissipation; Artificial intelligence; Automotive engineering; Efficient energy use; Pneumatic artificial muscles; Brake; Robotics; Computer science; DC motor; Robot,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00065-7_8 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iser/iser2012.html#ShinYNK12 http://hcr.cau.ac.kr/pages/paper/motorvbrake.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00065-7_8,,10.1007/978-3-319-00065-7_8,83478831,,0,007-322-141-702-193; 011-831-640-027-727; 015-601-016-183-314; 020-909-405-176-064; 022-283-915-605-763; 030-975-512-950-252; 034-337-381-194-969; 038-469-627-411-75X; 043-798-162-884-255; 053-384-244-849-392; 055-430-568-371-329; 079-438-683-896-523; 090-151-516-102-909; 110-966-459-250-382; 116-748-975-116-043; 141-720-577-808-484,2

The prototype motor has shown that piezoelectric stack actuators can be used for rotary inchworm motor. The discrete linear motion of piezoelectric stacks can be converted into rotary stepping motion. The stacks with its high force and displacement output are suitable actuators for use in piezoelectric motor. The designed motor is capable of delivering high torque and speed. Critical issues involving the design and operation of piezoelectric motors were studied. The tolerance between the contact shoes and the rotor has proved to be very critical to the performance of the motor. Based on the prototype motor, a waveform optimization scheme was proposed and implemented to improve the performance of the motor. The motor was successfully modeled in MATLAB. The model closely represents the behavior of the prototype motor. Using the motor model, the input waveforms were successfully optimized to improve the performance of the motor in term of speed, torque, power and precision. These optimized waveforms drastically improve the speed of the motor at different frequencies and loading conditions experimentally. The optimized waveforms also increase the level of precision of the motor. The use of the optimized waveform is a break-away from the traditional use of sinusoidal and square waves as the driving signals. This waveform optimization scheme can be applied to any inchworm motors to improve their performance.

Although these are widely known statistics, no comprehensive solution exists to reduce back injuries. While products like dollies and carts have been designed to solve particular tasks like moving materials, an all-encompassing solution to alleviate back injuries has yet to be proposed. This is largely due to the dynamic complexity involved with accommodating the various tasks required by different occupations. While the majority of some workers spend their days stooping to move materials, others predominantly walk bent over to perform duties like vacuuming.But at the most basic level, professions with high rates of back injuries mainly have two common motions: stooping and walking. Therefore, to successfully reduce back injuries, a device must reduce back muscle strain by supporting the torso during stooping while still permitting walking. This dissertation proposes five hip actuation designs to solve this fundamental problem. The intent is for the hip actuators to be incorporated into a full exoskeleton which interfaces with the user’s torso and legs to support the lower back during stooping and/or walking.The first hip actuation design is a simple wrap spring clutch which is beneficial for tasks like static stooping and bent walking (walking while stooped). The second hip actuation design adds a spring to the first design to conserve energy and dynamically support the back during stooping and standing upright. The third hip actuation design adds a locking feature to the spring in the second design to control when the spring’s energy is released. The fourth hip actuation design uses one large, high-torque motor to support the torso during bending and walking.

First, the proposed quasi-direct drive actuation comprising of our customized high torque density motors and low ratio transmission mechanism significantly reduces the mass of the robot and produces high backdrivability. Second, we derive a biomechanics model-based control that generates biological torque profile for versatile control of both squat and stoop lifting assistance. The control algorithm detects lifting postures using compact inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to generate an assistive profile that is proportional to the biological torque produced from our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot exhibits low mechanical impedance (1.5 Nm resistive torque) when it is unpowered and 0.5 Nm resistive torque with zero-torque tracking control. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking is less than 0.29 Nm (1.21% error of 24 Nm peak torque). Compared with squatting without the exoskeleton, the controller reduces 87.5%, 80% and 75% of the of three knee extensor muscles (average peak EMG of 3 healthy subjects) during squat with 50% of biological torque assistance.",,,,,Torque; Exoskeleton; Mechanical impedance; Biomechanics; Squat; Computer science; Control theory; Resistive touchscreen; Inertial measurement unit; Control theory,,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1902.07106 https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07106 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190207106Y/abstract,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1902.07106,,,2954376713,,0,000-029-747-488-93X; 000-106-910-658-705; 006-077-695-687-172; 008-589-158-200-885; 016-426-097-457-014; 022-025-120-812-388; 023-360-950-534-182; 027-304-971-477-489; 028-862-609-405-071; 030-507-157-672-704; 031-787-433-355-55X; 033-764-495-058-252; 034-120-902-544-673; 038-512-819-535-096; 038-721-557-967-796; 039-416-036-089-129; 041-136-103-127-355; 043-335-472-372-203; 049-382-397-989-800; 049-450-488-325-69X; 049-605-800-281-032; 052-718-154-842-091; 054-028-823-446-315; 054-943-873-543-614; 056-353-641-915-733; 059-579-998-080-100; 060-359-253-947-452; 061-305-826-872-949; 061-766-059-004-893; 071-519-097-814-664; 075-483-804-565-42X; 104-075-675-651-256; 106-527-885-911-500; 107-096-910-931-285; 137-267-778-313-325; 142-620-654-763-338; 171-657-287-635-73X; 184-879-768-742-478,0

Stored energy densities higher than the air-gap electrostatic actuators accrue from high relative dielectric permittivity (1300) and breakdown strength (1 MV/cm) of the films. The piezoelectric longitudinal and transverse strain coefficients were measured by a nonresonance technique through a modified Mach-Zehnder laser interferometer; at a dc bias of 75 k V/cm, d33 was measured to be 220 pC/N; evaluation of the film as a bimorph yielded a value of —88 pC/N for d31 at 200 kV/cm ac field.

Advances in enabling technologies of electric power generation, distribution, and consumption have made the use of electric actuators more competitive. Electric actuation can be based on Electro Hydrostatic (EHA), Electro Mechanical (EMA), or Magnetostrictive Actuator (MA) concepts. The governing idea in the TDFS model approach is to separate the high (electrical) and low (mechanical) frequency parts of the model and thereafter only consider the low frequency part. Electrical components as current and/or voltage converters/inverters are then described in terms of RMS-vales of currents and voltages and efficiencies or in circuit diagrams in form of load dependent resistors and in electromachines by means of load dependent loss resistances equivalent with their electromechanical efficiencies. Step-down and step-up voltage converters are described as fictive DC/DC transformers. The reactive power drawn by the motor is accounted for by a parallel electrical branch comprising a Current sink. This approach makes it possible to reduce the complexity of power system models of tentative systems to such extent that the resulting computational tool easily can be used for studies of the whole system performance during entire flight missions and/or for optimization. The electrical machine of the studied actuator is a permanent magnet synchronous machine intended for operation at relatively low speed and high torque. The continuous output power is 1 [kW] with a voltage level of 270 VDC at the DC-bus. This machine shows promising performance for more electric aircraft applications. The modeling approach in this paper shows that it is possible to perform simulations on entire flight missions. This feature constitutes a valuable tool for decision making, when different technologies are to be compared.

The goal of this paper is to develop a novel, high-power, self-balancing, and passively and software-controlled actively compliant hip exoskeleton that can assist with movement and maintain balance in both the sagittal and frontal planes. The developed hip exoskeleton includes powered hip abduction/adduction and hip flexion/extension joints. Each actuation unit employs a modular and compact series elastic actuator (SEA) with a high torque-to-weight ratio. It provides mechanical compliance at the interface between the exoskeleton and the wearer to ensure safety and a natural gait in the coupled wearer-exoskeleton system. A new balance controller based on the extrapolated center of mass concept is presented for maintaining walking stability. This controller reacts to perturbations in balance and produces a compliant guidance force through a combination of the passive elasticity of the SEA and active compliant control based on adaptive admittance control. The function of the hip exoskeleton is not to override human control, but rather to involve the wearer in movement control in order to avoid conflicts between wearer and exoskeleton. Our preliminary experiments on a healthy subject wearing the hip exoskeleton demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the proposed hip exoskeleton and controller for walking balance control.",23,1,274,285,Torque; Exoskeleton; Gait; Actuator; Hip abduction; Healthy subjects; Hip flexion; Computer science; Simulation; Control theory,,,,National Science Foundation; North Carolina State University Faculty Scholar Program,https://xplqa30.ieee.org/document/8246978/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8246978/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8246978/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmech.2018.2790358,,10.1109/tmech.2018.2790358,2781999526,,0,005-457-224-395-067; 008-509-398-964-232; 011-996-548-329-365; 015-103-035-955-074; 024-998-971-317-573; 025-563-894-841-673; 031-691-328-293-557; 033-106-076-759-527; 035-281-092-027-722; 040-355-989-582-376; 043-798-162-884-255; 044-586-687-721-696; 044-809-315-386-570; 047-168-224-034-790; 048-107-822-216-68X; 052-480-790-592-161; 059-692-646-020-504; 063-119-652-443-928; 064-108-921-178-329; 084-910-378-451-525; 090-107-930-854-825; 097-297-095-863-430; 102-176-141-296-00X; 102-222-124-199-018; 105-783-871-252-897; 110-782-610-483-212; 118-457-463-978-718; 130-891-990-215-129; 131-180-103-287-456; 146-117-187-591-019; 177-061-544-531-79X; 177-204-514-116-996; 181-728-655-544-152,41

Darbyshire,"Future spacecraft will, of necessity, require rapid rotational manouvreability or agility. Such rapid retargeting manoeuvres are often subject to the physical limits of actuators. Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) are employed as primary actuators because of their high torque control capability. A typical configuration used is the 4 Single-Gimbal Control Moment (4SGCMG) pyramid mounting arrangement [48]. In the 1960s researchers studied an arrangement of CMGs called Twin Control Moment Gyros (TCMGs) [6, 11,20]. At the time these configurations were considered unsuitable for large satellite platforms, and the 4SGCMG pyramid configuration became the most common arrangement. The research in this report revisits their work, to address the suitability of TCMGs to future small satellite missions. Candidate configurations of both SGCMG and TCMG arrangements are considered as possible replacements for the 4SGCMG pyramid configuration. The candidate configurations are compared m terms of torque capability, power consumed and mass and volume occupied. In this report the principles of Single-Control Moment Gyro and Twin-Control Moment Gyro operation are studied. The study of Euler's equations and controller principles lead to the implementation of an attitude control system in SIMULINK, for which results are compared with previous work [46]. The results of a sizing/selection process show that the 4SGCMG pyramid configuration performs the best all round in terms of torque developed, power consumed and mass and volume occupied. Of the candidate configurations the 6SGCMG pyramid configuration stands out as a possible replacement for the baseline configuration. Of the TCMG configurations the 3TCMG pyramid configuration is the most promising. It is recommended that the 3TCMG pyramid configuration is investigated further. If the total mass of this system could be reduced it could be a contender as a possible replacement for the 4SGCMG pyramid configuration.",,,,,Baseline (configuration management); Torque; Actuator; Satellite; Sizing; Spacecraft; Computer science; Control theory; Pyramid; Control theory,,,,,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/843363/,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/843363/,,,2800177380,,0,,0

Suple; Chandrakant R. Sonawane; S. S. Thipse; J. P. Mohite; N. B. Chougule,"Since many years diesel engines are powering commercial vehicles. Of late, governments are promoting the use of natural gas (NG) as a fuel for such vehicles to reduce pollution. Thereafter, natural gas engines have witnessed faster development, especially for use in commercial vehicles. City bus is probably the most common NG commercial vehicle, dedicated to ferry passengers across the city. Some places impose a safety speed limit on such vehicles considering local traffic conditions. Thus, a typical scenario faced by such vehicles includes low drive speeds, high loads, frequent halts for passenger pick up and drop, signals, etc. Such vehicles thus need high torque at low engine speeds to manage these daily occuring conditions. Aim of this paper is to enhance torque at low-engine speed zone. Number of options such as the use of a turbocharger, direct injection of fuel, variable valve actuation, programmable waste-gates, etc. can help to realize higher engine outputs. The intent here is to study the effect of compression ratio and understand the extent of change in torque in engine low-engine speed region. Current study consists of modelling a reference commercial vehicle engine of six cylinders. A virtual model is built and its ability to represent actual engine performance from testbed is verified. Further, such model undergoes iterations of change in compression ratio and different parameters are studied for their relation with torque.",,,189,195,Diesel fuel; Torque; Automotive engineering; Valve actuator; Turbocharger; Compression ratio; Speed limit; Computer science; Cylinder (engine); Natural gas,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-3639-7_22 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-3639-7_22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3639-7_22,,10.1007/978-981-15-3639-7_22,3037113914,,0,004-763-099-877-591; 050-077-445-861-559; 061-938-710-804-792; 099-807-629-306-859; 103-303-557-390-37X; 107-035-907-475-662; 137-229-021-006-422; 167-800-456-885-006; 179-248-551-444-937,0

Reducing rotor inertia in a DC motor design invariably means reducing the peak torque output, which in turn compromises the device's ability to render stiff, massive objects. To meet the large dynamic range requirement in haptic device applications without compromise, we present the design of an actuator that produces high torque on a low inertia rotor through the use of the eddy current braking effect. Eddy currents couple the rotor to a spinning, motorized stator through the action of a torque proportional to relative speed. In our design, permanent magnets are fixed to a two-part stator such that magnetic fields with alternating polarity transect a thin, aluminum disk-shaped rotor. By shifting the relative angular position of the two opposing stator parts under motor control, the magnetic fields traversing the rotor can be modulated between near zero and full intensity. Thus the torque output is effectively clutched under computer control. In this paper we analyze the limits to the speed of response of this design and present characterization results obtained using a prototype device.",,,83,89,Inertia; Torque; Rotor (electric); Squirrel-cage rotor; Stator; Computer science; Wound rotor motor; Eddy current brake; Control theory; DC motor,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006183774 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6183774&contentType=Conference+Publications https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinyi_Ge2/publication/241628924_A_high_bandwidth_low_inertia_motor_for_haptic_rendering_based_on_clutched_eddy_current_effects/links/56f950ac08ae95e8b6d3fc89.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/haptics/haptics2012.html#GePWSGS12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/haptic.2012.6183774,,10.1109/haptic.2012.6183774,2123884532,,0,008-558-344-493-35X; 012-439-951-550-355; 024-655-587-516-194; 033-697-353-852-736; 060-005-372-201-313; 073-604-655-701-613; 076-261-114-349-829; 087-482-698-014-085; 105-428-335-401-434; 112-590-280-301-151,2

The first version of the actuator disc momentum theory is more than 100 years old. The extension towards very low rotational speeds with high torque for discs with a constant circulation, became available only recently. This theory gives the performance data like the power coefficient and average velocity at the disc. Potential flow calculations have added flow properties like the distribution of this velocity. The present paper addresses the comparison of actuator discs representing propellers and wind turbines, with emphasis on the velocity at the disc. At a low rotational speed, propeller discs have an expanding wake while still energy is put into the wake. The high angular momentum of the wake, due to the high torque, creates a pressure deficit which is supplemented by the pressure added by the disc thrust. This results in a positive energy balance while the wake axial velocity has lowered. In the propeller and wind turbine flow regime the velocity at the disc is 0 for a certain minimum but non-zero rotational speed. At the disc, the distribution of the axial velocity component is non-uniform in all flow states. However, the distribution of the velocity in the plane containing the axis, the meridian plane, is practically uniform (deviation approximately 0.2 %) for wind turbine disc flows with tip speed ratio λ &gt; 5, almost uniform (deviation 2 %) for wind turbine disc flows with λ = 1 and propeller flows with advance ratio J = Π, and non-uniform (deviation 5 %) for the propeller disc flow with wake expansion at J = 2 Π. These differences in uniformity are caused by the different strengths of the singularity in the wake boundary vorticity strength at its leading edge.;                         </jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/wes-2020-51,,10.5194/wes-2020-51,,,0,,0

Vasanth,"Research on humanoid robots are widespread particularly in industrial application. Currently, in the robotics industry, there is not much progress towards how an actual humanoid can be made. Humanoid robots are envisioned to perform an everyday function which involves various sensors and actuators have to satisfy certain conditions that are being used to actuate and run the process of a humanoid. Particularly individual high torque motors which are designed to work under heavy loads that are capable of being used in a humanoid. The walking cycle of a humanoid being the primary section in all applications. It is essential to understand how a humanoid robot can be made to walk dynamically. With the variation in temperature, climate change, and magnetic field a humanoid robot may face interference regarding its sensors and magnetometer. The foot of the robot is the part of the humanoid which has the highest area of contact either with the surface which can be used to understand the surface conditions and properties of the surface. In the current study an attempt has been made with the walking pattern in dynamic balancing condition which includes data from flex force sensor. This data can further be filtered and calibrated to conclude the properties of the surface nature.

The actuators are constructed using direct mechatronic drives such as motor-spindles, plane-parallel and rod-end linear motors, and high-torque rotary motors built in inclined two-axes rotary tables. The analysis of the development of existing main and driven element motion drives of machine tools shows a progressive reduction of their kinematic chains and simplification of their designs if more advanced electric drive motors are developed and applied. The principles of operation of these mechatronic drives are presented along with their main characteristics, possible applications, gained benefits, and limitations for their wider use in CNC machine tools. It is shown that improving the structure and performance of these drives will expand the field of their application and simplify the kinematics and design of CNC machine tools due to embedding the drive motors directly in the driven elements of machines. Manufacturing and application of mechatronic drives in the form of ready-made unified modules (motor-spindles, plane-parallel linear and rod-end motors, rotary and inclined rotary tables with built-in motors) produced by specialized companies will allow machine-tool companies to reduce the design and manufacturing time, increase the accuracy and reliability, and reduce the cost of machine tools.",,,,,Engineering; Control engineering; Actuator; Numerical control; Driven element; Mechatronics; Kinematics; Embedding; Linear motor; Machine tool,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mehatronnye-privody-v-metallorezhuschih-stankah-s-chpu,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mehatronnye-privody-v-metallorezhuschih-stankah-s-chpu,,,2265933550,,0,,0

Magnetorheological (MR) brakes are viable actuators for haptics since they provide high torque-to-volume ratios with fast response. However, they tend to be rather large and use high current inputs. The actuator size is mainly affected by two factors: (1) design of the magnetic flux path, and (2) the number of coil turns inside the device. To address these issues, we developed a new MR-brake combining serpentine flux path design and a permanent magnet. The new design also provides a fail-safe feature with the help of the permanent magnet while reducing the actuator size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such rotary MR-brake. The design was optimized using the Taguchi optimization method. A prototype was fabricated with 45.5 mm diameter, 63.5 mm length and 2.0 Nm maximum torque output. The prototype was tested to assess its effectiveness as a 1 degree-of-freedom haptic device in virtual wall collision.

Katayama; Etsuko Kobayashi; Ichiro Sakuma,"Forceps manipulating robots have been developed for assisting surgeons to realize high-quality and precise operation in laparoscopic surgery. Currently several commercially available systems greatly contributed to operations. Still their large size causes problems in the operating theater, thus they need to be miniaturized. We developed a new compact forceps manipulator. It consists of two parts; friction wheel mechanism which rotates and translates the forceps (62/spl times/52/spl times/150[mm/sup 3/], 0.6[kg]), and gimbals mechanism which drives the forceps around the incision hole on the abdomen to determine the direction of forceps (135/spl times/165/spl times/300[mm/sup 3/], 1.1[kg]). Thus, the four DOF motion of forceps in laparoscopic surgery was realized. Ultrasonic motor was adopted for actuating friction wheel mechanism because of its small size, high torque and cleanliness. We controlled the manipulator in semi-closed loop using rotary encoders. Mechanical evaluation results showed that feedback loop control and compensation of control command improved the positioning accuracy. Positioning accuracy of the gimbals mechanism was less than 0.6 [deg], and that of friction wheel mechanism was less than 0.2 [mm] in translation and 1 [deg] in rotation. In vitro experiment simulating usage in the clinical environment revealed that this manipulator realized stable motion even if the liquid materials such as blood attached onto the forceps. The new manipulator was promising and useful in laparoscopic surgery.",,,3678,3683,Gimbal; Engineering; Ultrasonic motor; Motion control; Manipulator; Laparoscopic surgery; Forceps; Rotary encoder; Control theory; Robot,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iros/iros2005.html#SuzukiKKS05,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iros.2005.1545550,,10.1109/iros.2005.1545550,2085767670,,0,006-622-071-337-124; 029-768-636-817-157; 036-217-065-766-52X; 037-960-689-465-052; 048-589-882-439-556; 058-077-642-298-487; 078-962-461-584-430; 082-555-693-278-738; 092-374-299-291-15X; 095-683-967-435-584; 100-142-599-088-802; 133-895-270-385-629; 160-631-698-948-904,4

Krome; Jörg Wallaschek,"By appropriate superposition of two standing waves, a traveling wave can be excited in the ring-shaped stator of a traveling wave motor. Thus, the material points on the surface of the stator perform an elliptical motion. A second disk, pressed against the stator, is driven by frictional forces, generated in the interface between stator and rotor. Traveling wave motors produce a very high torque at low rotational speed. Their simple mechanical design and good controllability make these motors a very promising alternative to small electro-magnetic motors. The mechanical oscillations of high frequency are excited by piezoelectric ceramic actuators, bonded to the surface of the stator. The dynamic behavior of the stator is strongly influenced by these actuators. Since it is difficult to produce big ceramic rings and bond them to the stators, single piezoelectric elements have to be used for the excitation of large stators. The geometry of the ceramic actuators as well as the stiffness of the bonding layer do have marked influence on the efficiency of the excitation, because the actuation mechanism is of induced strain type and the stator is excited by tangential stresses in the bonding layer. In this paper, the influence of the shape of the ceramics on the vibration of the stator is investigated using the finite element method. A detailed model taking into account the piezoelectric effect in the ceramic actuators as well as the exact geometry of the stator is used to calculate the transfer function between the electrical excitation and the mechanical vibrations of the stator. The results allow to compare the efficiency of different actuator configurations.",7,2,157,161,Piezoelectricity; Finite element method; Actuator; Rotor (electric); Electric motor; Materials science; Vibration; Standing wave; Acoustics; Stator,,,,,,,,,3020816155,,0,,0

Even though motor drivers are able to provide high torque control bandwidth under nominal conditions, they suffer from various physical constraints which degrade both output amplitude and bandwidth of torque control loop. In this context, peak power limit of a power source, as one of those constraints, has not been fully explored from the control perspective so far. A conventional and practical way of considering peak power limit in control systems is to model it as a trivial torque saturation derived from the allowable torque at maximum speed satisfying the constraint. However, this model is overly conservative leading to poor closed loop performance when actuators operate below their maximum speed. In this paper, novel ways of incorporating peak power limits into both classical and optimal controllers are presented upon a theoretical analysis revealing its effects on stability and performance.",,,,,Torque; Motion control; Mechanical system; Actuator; Control system; Amplitude; High torque; Computer science; Control theory; Bandwidth (signal processing),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1907.html#abs-1907-03279 https://tw.arxiv.org/abs/1907.03279?context=cs.SY https://au.arxiv.org/abs/1907.03279 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03279 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190703279S/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03279v1 https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03279v1 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1907.03279 https://ru.arxiv.org/abs/1907.03279?context=eess.SY,https://tw.arxiv.org/abs/1907.03279?context=cs.SY,,,2953500656,,0,002-597-269-698-569; 004-434-307-613-746; 013-233-653-199-627; 016-539-084-328-134; 023-695-429-703-605; 027-633-028-776-178; 029-598-598-797-562; 030-259-893-569-000; 040-829-222-806-890; 044-025-815-598-929; 044-840-018-217-848; 045-073-259-578-46X; 049-138-912-504-499; 051-766-851-183-482; 055-008-520-041-888; 056-527-313-774-959; 061-693-970-641-747; 066-548-658-422-946; 080-629-393-885-751; 082-185-036-822-769; 083-817-536-113-773; 088-317-030-676-254; 090-779-606-031-714; 096-156-583-505-565; 096-997-032-448-599; 103-962-305-355-26X; 104-778-611-014-689; 110-701-775-193-611; 112-384-439-067-794; 113-271-184-015-364; 120-121-637-186-378; 125-725-940-827-333; 127-768-599-336-989; 131-961-639-848-436; 132-612-382-745-941; 167-171-612-507-789; 168-147-034-722-60X; 169-275-099-201-306; 169-771-777-046-249; 179-429-286-806-871; 188-045-962-348-380,0

So, Malaysian entrepreneur used a moulding device that connected air compressor and an actuator for large scale production. But for the moulding device still has disadvantage such as the speed, torque and force are not suitable for high quantities of orders. After investigate the disadvantage of the traditional moulding device, a new power moulding device embedded with electrical motor will be introduced. The objective of this research is to design and analyze the best performance of double stator permanent magnet motor that will be used in the moulding device. The double stator permanent magnet motor (DSPMM) is an electric motor that can have high torque density which can it can save time and produce a large number of tart cookies in one time. Before design the DSPMM, the previous motor is studied to get their specification. Then, the DSPMM is design by using SolidWorks software and simulate by using the Ansys Maxwell. The parameter of the motor is divided into fixed parameter and variable parameter. The fixed parameter is diameter of outer coil and size of rotor while the variable parameter is are length of magnet, number of turns and diameter of the inner stator. In this project, when the ratio number of turns is increase, the value of back emf and torque is increase. The best model of motor is choosing when the flux density between outer stator and inner stator is same which 1.5 T.

It was shown that free-vibration of elastic mechanical structures can generate energy-efficient hopping/walking behavior. However, the velocity of such robots is very low. From this perspective, this paper presents a novel design strategy for running robots which makes use of torsional vibration of elastic beam.

We also present a novel foot contact sensor suitable for legged locomotion with hard impacts. A 2.2 kg quadruped robot with a large range of motion is assembled from eight identical actuator modules and four lower legs with foot contact sensors. Leveraging standard plastic 3D printing and off-the-shelf parts results in a lightweight and inexpensive robot, allowing for rapid distribution and duplication within the research community. We systematically characterize the achieved impedance at the foot in both static and dynamic scenarios, and measure a maximum dimensionless leg stiffness of 10.8 without active damping, which is comparable to the leg stiffness of a running human. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the quadruped, we present a novel controller which combines feedforward contact forces computed from a kino-dynamic optimizer with impedance control of the center of mass and base orientation. The controller can regulate complex motions while being robust to environmental uncertainty.",,,,,Torque; Actuator; Impedance control; Legged robot; Computer science; Control theory; DC motor; Control theory; Contact force; Robot,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191000093G/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00093 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00093,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00093,,,2977389550,,0,008-952-457-705-342; 008-992-691-901-022; 011-141-909-650-389; 012-477-333-037-869; 021-941-363-571-627; 023-574-146-036-24X; 023-695-429-703-605; 030-774-131-200-852; 031-467-417-572-682; 032-321-162-905-792; 035-892-406-231-674; 049-711-997-321-34X; 056-887-004-805-773; 059-579-998-080-100; 059-586-289-580-933; 062-557-506-055-330; 066-548-658-422-946; 071-186-651-563-151; 071-318-471-616-502; 075-282-281-990-468; 080-188-199-839-902; 092-878-008-300-853; 094-415-628-494-005; 096-728-086-585-040; 107-096-910-931-285; 112-894-920-924-254; 123-236-832-206-708; 124-299-791-179-495; 142-181-424-421-293; 144-525-663-500-780; 144-588-688-546-214; 162-437-028-022-858; 164-263-310-830-854; 170-729-374-735-150; 174-853-228-042-640,4

The actuator consists of a combination of a spindle-driven MACCEPA (Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable Equilibrium Position Actuator) and a spring acting in parallel, (dis)engaged by means of a simple on/off mechanism depending on the phase of the gait cycle. Such design approach is inspired by two clearly distinctive gait phases of a knee joint, one with a high velocity and low torque, and another one with low velocity and high torque profiles.

Ever since the first industry robot being invented half a century ago, the robotics field have been developed rapidly, and all sorts of robots are playing more and more important roles in all human production and daily life activities.The main requirements for robots have been focused on rigidity, high torque and precision motion until recently, as traditionally the major application of robots are along factory production lines, with their working environment well known and controlled, performing jobs that are highly repetitive. To ensure the consistency of production, rigid robots that provides precise motion with high payload capacity are preferred. Thus, position controlled high torque servos have been dominating the industry. These actuators are also combined with force/torque sensors to enable force control capability on robotic systems, but due to various limitations of such setup, it is difficult to realize dynamic motions where impulsive loading is frequently recurrent. During the recent decade, research efforts in the robotics field have been made in the development of Series Elastic Actuators (SEA), seeking for alternative actuation solutions to meet the requirements for dynamic robotic systems. Although there are a hand full of successful cases, the complicity and difficulty down the route is quite obvious. Besides, the respond bandwidth of any SEA is strictly limited by the property of its elastic component, resulting in customization that is very application specific.The recent rapid development of Proprioceptive Actuators, also know as Quasi-Direct Drive Actuators (or QDD for abbreviation), provides a simple actuation solution that not only features torque control capability, but also provides a very wide response bandwidth as well as inherent compliance. Thus its application on various robotic systems is definitely intriguing and worth of exploration. The work presented in this dissertation involves the development and discussion of the application of Proprioceptive Actuators on several different dynamic robotic systems, including a three-finger robotic hand called DAnTE, a non-anthropomorphic bipedal robot called NABi-2 and a quadruped robot with very unique kinematics configuration, called ALPHRED-2. Underactuated anthropomorphic fingers are developed and applied on DAnTE, and a potential energy flow theory is developed to assist the development of the mechanical intelligence in these underactuated fingers to realize gesture dexterity. Along with the application of Proprioceptive Actuators on legged robots, an Impact Transfer Factor theory is proposed to quantify the response of a robotic limb to a impact in terms of impact sensing from a whole-system point of view. As outlook of the presented work, an upgraded version of DAnTE as well as an open source kid-size humanoid robot platform are introduced. Both systems are driven by well-packaged Proprioceptive Actuator modules and are expected to possess dexterous force control and high dynamic performance capabilities, and both of them are designed to serve as reliable robot platforms to carry further research in related topics.",,,,,Control engineering; Torque; Payload; Artificial intelligence; Robotics; Kinematics; Computer science; Servomechanism; Humanoid robot; Underactuation; Robot,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9dk9r8d3,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9dk9r8d3,,,2997785869,,0,,0

Annual Conference,1557170x,,United States,Robert W Horst; Richard R Marcus,"Active orthotic devices require actuators with high torque, a free movement mode, high efficiency, and small size and weight. The FlexCVA is a new type of actuator that addresses these requirements in a unique way. It provides continuously varying torque through the use of two belts alternately deflected by cams. The belts alternate in supplying output torque with one belt pulling the output while the slack is removed from the other belt. The drive ratio is automatically adjusted in response to the load by varying the deflection distance of the belts. The resulting actuator prototype has been demonstrated to supply up to 34 Nm of output torque, and its free movement mode allows it to be backdriven at speeds greater than 400 deg/sec.",2006,,2425,2428,,,"Biomimetics/instrumentation; Computer-Aided Design; Electric Power Supplies; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Humans; Muscle Contraction/physiology; Muscle, Skeletal/physiology; Orthotic Devices; Robotics/instrumentation",,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17946511,17946511,,,,0,,0

They offer advantages of low speed, low inertia and high torque operation without the need for gearboxes. They are now successfully competing with conventional electromagnetic motors in applications requiring small positioning motors. Ultrasonic stepper motors and piezoactuators have not competitors in the field of ultraprecision positioning drives. Ultrasonic motors convert high frequency vibrations of a structure excited by piezoelectric elements into rotor or slider motion by a frictional drive. This principle has been configured into many embodiments, giving rapid response times, holding torque without power applied and potentially silent motion. Their miniaturization for use in MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), microrobotics and the watch industry is particularly exciting, since they have a simple construction and excellent performance for their size. Ultrasonic motors have the potential to meet space research needs as actuators for telerobotics applications. The current difficulties in designing high performance ultrasonic motors are associated with the lack of complete models and general design rules, especially in the analysis of the frictional drive between the rotor and stator. The technical problems associated with required tolerances in construction, bonding piezoelectric materials to a stator structure and the performance of different friction layer materials are not completely solved. This work discusses the state-of -the-art ultrasonic miniature motor's research, commercial application and future trends.© (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Currently available CMGs are too large and heavy, and available miniature CMGs do not provide sufficient control authority for use on practical satellites. This primarily results from the need to greatly increase the speed of rotation of the flywheel in order to reduce the flywheel size and mass. This goal was achieved by making use of a proprietary, space-qualified, high-speed (100,000 rpm) motor technology to spin the flywheel at a speed ten times faster than other known miniature CMGs under development. NASA is supporting innovations in propulsion, power, and guidance and navigation systems for low-cost small spacecraft. One of the key enabling technologies is attitude control mechanisms. CMGs are particularly attractive for spacecraft attitude control since they can achieve higher torques with lower mass and power than reaction wheels, and they provide continuous torque capability that enables precision pointing (in contrast to on-off thruster control). The aim of this work was to develop a miniature, variable-speed CMG that is sized for use on small satellites. To achieve improved agility, these spacecraft must be able to slew at high rate, which requires attitude control actuators that can apply torques on the order of 5 N-m. The MVS-CMG is specifically designed to achieve a high-torque output with a minimum flywheel and system mass. The flywheel can be run over a wide range of speeds, which is important to help reduce/eliminate potential gimbal lock, and can be used to optimize the operational envelope of the CMG.",,,,,Propulsion; Gimbal; Engineering; Control moment gyroscope; Torque; Attitude control; Gyroscope; Reaction wheel; Flywheel; Control theory,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20120006653 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/265047 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120006653,http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20120006653,,,153787972,,0,,0

In this paper, it is shown that by coordinating the feedback linearization design of the mechanical link dynamics with that of the electrical motor dynamics, greater control accuracy can be achieved.

Salisbury,"<jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Summary.</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Previous attempts to predict the effects of drilling fluids on borehole stability in shale have been unsatisfactory. This paper describes laboratory equipment capable of simulating downhole conditions to permit evaluation of drilling fluids by testing the alteration of natural shale specimens when drilled and exposed to drilling fluid under an annular flow regime for an extended period of time. The paper discusses ramifications of the shale alteration relative to such operational problems as torque, drag, and stuck pipe.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Borehole stability is a critical factor in the cost of drilling and completing a well. Some of the problems caused by an unstable borehole are high torque, drag, bridging, and fill; stuck pipe; difficulty with directional control; slow rate of penetration, high mud costs; cementing failures and high cementing costs; and failure to obtain logs and poor log interpretation. Most borehole instability occurs when water-based muds are used to drill shale formations. Such borehole instability is related to hydration and dispersion mechanisms, which in turn are related to the interaction of shale with the drilling fluid. Laboratory and field studies have shown that shale hydration and borehole instability can be avoided by the use of oil mud with activity of the emulsified internal water phase equal to or less than the in-situ activity of the water in the shale formation. Environmental considerations, however, often preclude the use of oil mud. Efforts to characterize shales and to predict stability in different types of water-based drilling fluids have met with little success. This lack of success can be attributed to the complexity of the shale/drilling-fluid interactions that include surface hydration, osmotic swelling, cation exchange, anion adsorption, and alkali-alteration phenomena. Borehole conditions created by these interactions, in turn, depend on exposure time, temperature, and stresses of the shale, as well as shear stress and shear rate of the fluid at the shale surface. With so many factors involved, the tendency has been to rely on simple tests, such as those for shale swelling by Chenevert, shale dispersion by Anderson and Edwards, and capillary suction time by Wilcox and Fisk as guides to drilling-fluid selection. While useful as part of an overall laboratory or field study, these tests of unconfined, unstressed shale at ambient conditions of temperature and pressure can be very misleading if used alone to predict the effects of a drilling fluid or additive on shale stability. A problem as complex as shale stability can best be addressed by studies of shales exposed to drilling fluids under simulated downhole conditions. Previous studies of this general type have provided much-needed guidance, but each study has failed to simulate one or more significant parameters. For example, the model borehole studies reported by Darley and Clark et al. simulated vertical stress, radial stress, and mud pressure, but not downhole temperatures. Studies reported by Simpsons included simulation of downhole temperature, but not vertical stress. With laboratory evaluations that are limited in scope and often misleading, the present tendency of drilling personnel is to look for improved shale stability from water-based drilling fluids on a trial-and-error basis. A research project was organized under the auspices of the Drilling Engineering Assoc. to develop a laboratory method to predict shale stability under simulated downhole conditions. The downhole simulation cell (DSC) equipment described below resulted from that program and now provides the industry with the means to evaluate drilling-fluids performance without the time, expense, and risk of a series of blind field trials.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>DSC Equipment</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>The DSC equipment shown schematically in Fig. 1 and by photograph in Fig. 2 provides laboratory simulation of overburden stress and confining pressure, as well as downhole temperature, fluid circulating pressure, and shear rate at the wall of the hole during drilling and circulating through a rock specimen. Downhole conditions can thus be simulated for a variety of studies of fluid/rock interactions. For example, in addition to the borehole-stability studies discussed in this paper, the DSC equipment has been used to study dynamic filtration during drilling of permeable rock.

A hydraulic ram is used to provide overburden stress on the specimen, with a maximum stress of approximately 10,000 psi [69 MPa] possible on specimens with 6.4-in.[16.3-cm] OD. Heat-transfer oil is used as confining fluid inside the specimen chamber. The maximum allowable confining pressure is 7,000 psi [48.3 MPa]. A bit-position/drilling-force hydraulic cylinder, which provides bit motion and force on bit during drilling, is used to drill completely through the rock specimen. Rotation of the bit shaft is provided by two hydraulic motors. Mud flow through the bit is obtained by means of a swivel seal in the vessel base. Provisions are made for mud circulation through the specimen after the hole has been drilled and the bit and drill shaft have been retracted. Mud is circulated through the ram piston on the top of the vessel. Cuttings removal and mud return circulation are provided by 0.75-in.[1.9-cm] tubing going to the cuttings catch vessels. This vessel is heated with 480-V band heaters. Copper coils embedded in the outer periphery of the vessel provide cooling. Water is flowed through the cooling coils at the end of the shale exposure testing to cool the specimen sufficiently for removal from the vessel. A caliper assembly was devised to measure borehole enlargement while testing was in progress. The mode of rock deterioration usually observed, however, has been softening or weakening of the shale, rather than hole erosion. This finding led to the use of the caliper shaft as an assembly placed in the hole to create an annulus for flow during the test, without extensive use of the caliper function. The annular velocity and circulating information in Table 1 is based on the 1.0-in. [2.54-cm]diameter of the caliper assembly and a 1.25-in.

Most of these braking mechanisms involve numerous mechanical components, that wear with time and lose precision, furthermore the mechanism are difficult to scale down in size while maintaining relatively large holding torques. In this paper, we propose the use of an off-the-shelf economic material, Hot-Melt-Adhesive (HMA), as a brake mechanism. HMA exhibits visco-elastic characteristics and has interesting properties as it can change phases from solid to plastic to liquid and vice versa. Its advantage is that it is reusable and durable. Experiments were performed to display the holding strength as well as the HMAs visco-elasticity in its solid state as a brake mechanism. The HMA requires no constant application of power when solid, and acts as a brake and visco-elastic damper depending on temperature. Results show that HMA can add compliance and high torque braking of joints.",,,416,425,Solid-state; Engineering; Damper; Torque; Actuator; Viscoelasticity; Versa; Brake; Hydraulic brake; Structural engineering; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25486-4_42 http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/769213/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icira/icira2011-1.html#GunuraBI11 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-25486-4_42,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25486-4_42,,10.1007/978-3-642-25486-4_42,2284314677,,0,009-260-808-527-429; 010-959-009-896-599; 012-328-797-916-723; 075-226-217-103-514; 079-414-896-807-68X; 080-525-345-404-646; 101-445-128-226-310; 106-112-810-399-309; 107-203-680-567-06X; 117-390-008-629-890; 136-336-602-655-540; 142-698-089-513-896; 150-343-139-971-199; 184-677-889-770-250,1

On the aspect of patients, they also need the supervision of the therapist as well as their active guidance and their expertise. Through the master-slave rehabilitation system, the therapist can adjust the training according to the patient's status with their expertise. Therefore, the master-slave rehabilitation system is better than the traditional robotic rehabilitation system in which the training is programmed beforehand. In this paper, a master-slave rehabilitation system including an upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation device (ULERD) as slave side and a human upper limb-like robot as master side is proposed. Considering that the force feedback that the therapist adjusts the training intensive or training mode (active or passive training) based on is most important during the rehabilitation. Therefore, a novel structure based on the Serial Elastic Actuator (SEA) is applied on a human upper limb-like robot for generating different resistance forces. By detecting the deflection of the elastic element, the interaction force between the human and robot can be calculated. Thanks to the high torque output actuator, the master device can mimic the spasticity of stroke patients by controlling the deflection of the elastic element. Active training can be realized for mild stroke patient with ULERD using an extended impedance control method. Therefore, therapists can perform both active training and passive training according the force feedback with proposed master-slave rehabilitation system.",,,141,145,Deflection (engineering); Engineering; Haptic technology; Actuator; Master/slave; Impedance control; Rehabilitation; High torque; Simulation; Robot,,,,,https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902208694852989 http://www.guolab.org/Papers/2013/ICMA2013-024.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icma.2013.6617907,,10.1109/icma.2013.6617907,1992740898,,0,001-349-141-647-448; 003-821-282-361-434; 016-442-390-432-166; 025-781-949-827-47X; 026-764-024-837-299; 055-663-723-455-088; 079-223-381-500-652; 081-686-309-932-55X; 097-139-920-509-017; 107-808-233-592-37X; 168-101-148-835-983,2

168-371-778-308-205,Why the Exlar T-LAM™ Servo Motors have Become the New Standard of Comparison for Maximum Torque Density and Power Efficiency,,2008,,,,,,Richard Welch,"According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 63-65% of a typical manufacturing plant’s monthly electric bill goes to pay for all the electricity consumed by the electric motors operating in the plant. Hence, with a steady rise in electricity cost along with constant pressure to lower manufacturing cost, if you ask plant managers to describe the three most important words associated with electric motors they quickly respond by saying its “efficiency”, “efficiency” and “efficiency”. As you can see, no matter how you arrange these three words “efficiency” is always at the top of your list. Furthermore, systems and design engineers who build equipment used in manufacturing plants constantly search for electric motors that provide the “most bang for least buck”. Therefore, producing electric motors that have the highest obtainable torque density (i.e., continuous torque output per motor volume) along with maximum power efficiency has become a real challenge for all motor manufacturers. To meet this challenge for both high torque density and maximum power efficiency, Exlar has developed its T-LAMTM stator that’s now being used in all SLM and SLG brushless DC servo motors and in all GSX and GSM rotary actuators [1]. Hence, the focus of this paper is to show you graphically why the T-LAM servo motor has become the new standard of comparison for torque density and power efficiency.",,,,,Servomotor; Direct torque control; Rotary actuator; Automotive engineering; Stall torque; Electric motor; Stator; Torque density; Computer science; Servo drive; Control theory,,,,,https://stevenengineering.com/Tech_Support/PDFs/EXLAR_T-LAM.pdf,https://stevenengineering.com/Tech_Support/PDFs/EXLAR_T-LAM.pdf,,,2577949240,,0,,0

Michael Mayer; Minoru Asada; Rodrigo da Silva Guerra,"In the Humanoid Leagues balancing during walking and running is still the biggest challenge for most of the teams. We present here some work in which a dynamic walker is stabilised by using a fast heavy rotor, a gyro. The dynamics of a symmetric, fast rotating gyro is different from that of a non-rotating solid body, e.g. in the case of small disturbances it tends to keep the axes the same. Results show that the rotor enhances the stability of the walking in the simulations. In a model for an actuated robot the rotor is used as a reaction wheel, i.e. the pitch of the robot is stabilised by accelerating and decelerating it. We see this method -though it is not biologically inspired - as an intermediate step for learning balancing in biped robots. The control algorithm responsible for balancing the pitch is discussed in detail. The simulations show that, by using this kind of stabilisation, movements like stand up, walk and jump are easily possible by using open loop control for the legs, however high torques for the rotor are necessary. Finally, a robot design that consists just of a trunk is presented.",,,71,80,Torque; Artificial intelligence; Open-loop controller; Rotor (electric); Reaction wheel; Jump; Robotics; Computer science; Simulation; Control theory; Robot; Reaction,,,,,,,,,2529565432,,0,,0

The project is developed at Robotics Laboratory, Mechanical Dept. of Politecnico di Milano, with the co-operation of INAIL National Prosthesis Centre. In particular, new issues deal with mechanical, electronic and IT solutions, in order to get larger efficiency, stability, safety and easy production, innovative step control for real-time acquisition of de-ambulation information and full prosthesis-patient adaptation. Lot of care was taken about analysis in manufacturing of most advanced prosthesis available in market. From this, different solutions were found out in opposition to actual production in order to overcome many limitations. Main limits are very expensive purchase of high performance devices and high maintenance costs. Bio-robotic prosthesis prototype, getting now its final development stage, is able to set continuously and dynamically its motion parameters in order to assure the largest safety and functionality to user. Mechanical design chosen has easiness as distinctive feature as well as high performances. Innovative solutions deal with motion control: in particular flexoextension of knee prosthesis is regulated by electromechanical actuation system based on several input signals coming from sensors. Thus, device behaviour gains high adaptation towards various deambulation condition. The device has been created equipped with energy accumulation. This feature makes amputated patient able to do complex movements as far as similar to natural ones. A special constant force spring provides storage and return of potential energy in order to let prosthesis straighten during swing stroke. A small shoe brake let step regulation acting on elastic element. Brake system fills up a very limited room and get high torque-size ratio. The whole mechanical structure has been optimized by FEM analysis, achieving weight reduction and functional improvement. The device can fit patient step working in different ways according to signal acquisition by sensors system. In particular input signals are flexion and compression, rate and acceleration. Input signals are received and elaborated by small STMicroelectronics chip in order to quickly supply output signal to brake acting system.

Abdellatif; Samer Alfayad; Arne-Christoph Hildebrandt; F.B. Ouezdou; Nazih Mechbal; Yahya Zweiri,"For humanoid robots, design of the ankle mechanism is still open research problem since high torque is required while compact structures have to be maintained. This paper investigates an enhanced design of 3 degree-of-freedom hydraulic hybrid ankle mechanism. The design is based on (US9327785) Alfayad et al. (2011). Using a hybrid kinematic structure with hydraulic actuation, allows us to reach a slender humanoid ankle shape while enabling the high torque performances required for stable walking. Performances analysis of the first version ankle mechanism designed for HYDROiD humanoid robot showed some limits mainly induced by seal friction and pistons misalignment. In this paper, the influence of the friction parameters is explored. A virtual model is developed to evaluate the performances of a new flexion/extension and adduction/abduction pistons arrangement. Then, a control algorithm is simulated and implemented, as an example, to the flexion/extension motion of the new ankle mechanism.

Heliquad is a multi-copter similar to Quadcopter, with four actuators diagonally symmetric from the center. Each actuator has two control inputs; the first input changes the propeller blades collective pitch (also called variable pitch), and the other input changes the rotation speed. For reliable operation and high torque characteristic requirement for yaw control, a cambered airfoil is used to design propeller blades. A neural network-based control allocation is designed to provide complete control authority even under a complete loss of one actuator. Nonlinear quaternion based outer loop position control, with proportional-derivative inner loop for attitude control and neural network-based control allocation is used in controller design. The proposed controller and Heliquad designs performance is evaluated using a software-in-loop simulation to track the position reference command under failure. The results clearly indicate that the Heliquad with an intelligent controller provides necessary tracking performance even under a complete loss of one actuator.",,,,,Airfoil; Attitude control; Actuator; Quaternion; Quadcopter; Computer science; Inner loop; Control theory; Control theory; Propeller,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07529 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2011.html#abs-2011-07529 https://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07529 https://za.arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07529 https://au.arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07529 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201107529K/abstract https://it.arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529 https://au.arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529 https://it.arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07529 https://za.arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07529,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07529,,,3104063258,,0,010-091-537-924-422; 015-887-057-766-424; 021-137-891-426-557; 022-648-313-969-702; 023-797-242-456-234; 034-480-351-716-641; 035-476-171-868-861; 038-656-756-715-323; 052-960-771-772-039; 055-613-855-651-413; 066-114-910-637-212; 081-249-080-734-225; 084-710-840-396-110; 097-040-900-489-370; 114-126-756-396-867; 118-933-968-749-317; 126-295-619-211-507; 180-246-493-480-230,0

The newly designed stator is a two sided vibrator consisting of a toothed metal disk with a piezoelectric ceramic ring bonded on both faces of the disk which generates a flexural traveling wave along the circumference of disk. In this configuration, the displacement on the surface of stator may not be confined. It also produces a large vibrating force and amplitude because the vibrator is sandwiched by two piezoelectric plates. It is possible to increase the torque by improving the vibration characteristics. We used the finite element method to compute the vibration mode of the motor of diameter 48 mm. A sixth mode was chosen as the operation mode with a resonance frequency of about 73 kHz. We fabricated a prototype according to this design and measured its performance. The performance measurement of the prototype motor showed that its stall torque was about 1.8 Nm and efficiency was 37% at 60% of the maximum torque. Compared to a conventional motor which employed a single sided piezoelectric vibrator of the same outer diameter, we obtained, with this prototype, a maximum torque of about twice as great.

Models of several different motor - sensor configurations were studied to determine dynamic characteristics. A reaction torque sensor fixed to the motor stator was implemented to decouple the transmission dynamics from the sensor. This resulted in a compact actuator with higher bandwidth and precision than could be obtained with an inline or joint sensor. Quasi-static testing demonstrated a closed-loop torque accuracy within 0.1% over the full range of torques. Torque ripple and friction effects, which accounted for errors of up to 7% in open-loop tests, were virtually eliminated. The mechanical bandwidth of the system approaches 300 Hz, but the current loop in the drive electronics limits the open-loop bandwidth to less than 10 Hz. Compensation techniques were utilized to increase the controllable bandwidth to greater than 200 Hz, demonstrating that the motor response can be drastically improved by closing a high bandwidth torque loop.",,,,,Torque sensor; Current loop; Engineering; Torque; Actuator; Stator; Torque ripple; Transmission (mechanics); Control theory; Bandwidth (signal processing),,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a270760.pdf http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7034 https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA270760 http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA270760,http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7034,,,1494277558,,0,,1

Since virtual worlds consist of physical models, it is appropriate to output the inherent force information necessary for the simulation to the user. The detailed design, construction, and control of a three degree freedom force output joystick will be presented. A novel kinematic design allows all three axes to be uncoupled, so that the system inertia matrix is diagonal. The two planar axes are actuated through an offset gimbal, and the third through a sleeved cable. To compensate for friction and inertia effects, this transmission is controlled by a force feedforward and a closed force feedback proportional loop. Workspace volume is a cone of 512 cubic inches, and the device bandwidth is maximized at 60 Hz for the two planar and 30 Hz for the third axis. Each axis is controlled by a motor/proportional magnetic particle brake combination fixed to the base. The innovative use of motors and brakes allows objects with high resistive torque requirements to be simulated without the stability and related safety issues involved with high torque, energy storing motors alone. Position, velocity, and applied endpoint force are sensed directly. Different control strategies are discussed and implemented, with an emphasis on how virtual environment force information, generated by the MIT Media Lab Computer Graphics and Animation Group BOLIO system, is transmitted to the device controller. The design constraints for a kinesthetic force feedback device can be summarized as: How can the symbiosis between the sense of presence in the virtual environment be maximized without compromising the interaction task under the constraints of the mechanical device limitations? Research in this field will yield insights to the optimal human sensory feedback mix for a wide spectrum of control and interaction problems.

This capability is coming from the use of wet friction clutch which able to dissipate more heat generated by high torque engine in slipping clutch during engagement process. One of inefficiency comes from the use of clutch fluid which tends to stick the clutch pairs, causing the drag torque when the fluid sheared by the clutch pair that rotates with different speed after the gear preselects action. The other drawback is occurred in the manual shift mode when the next gear that automatically preselected by the TCU before the gear shift is unmatched to the next gear as wished by the driver. The research was done to overcome the explained wet DCT drawback by improving the gear preselect action strategy so-called the seamless gear preselect strategy. This new strategy is achieved by improving the software of control algorithm rather than the DCT hardware for cost efficiency through software in the loop (SiL) method. This new strategy was achieved by simultaneously activate the gear preselect action during the fast filling phase of the ongoing clutch hydraulic system. The new gear preselect strategy make the reduction of unnecessary drag torque that normally occurs in wet DCT after gear preselect action in steady condition. The state of the art focusing on the subject of DCT construction, empiric system modeling, objectification and optimization method that were presented using a simulation environment to prepare the virtual gear shift optimization. After the model is fully confirmed, the optimization of wet DCT gear shift using genetic algorithm method was explained to meet the optimization objectives including the shift qualities, the uninterrupted torque during gear shifting and the limited heat generated as losses energy. The new gear preselect strategy is superior particularly for manual gear shift mode. The proposed strategy was carefully prepared in regards to the capability of the particular wet DCT construction particularly the hydraulic valve and gear shift actuator structure, while this optimization was done on the software basis alone without any further modification on the hardware. The optimization result confirmed the new gear preselect strategy is possible to be adapted in the particular seven speed wet DCT.",,,,,Systems modeling; Hydraulic machinery; Torque; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Software; Clutch; Transmission (mechanics); Computer science; Genetic algorithm,,,,,https://publikationsserver.tu-braunschweig.de/receive/dbbs_mods_00064217;lang=en,https://publikationsserver.tu-braunschweig.de/receive/dbbs_mods_00064217;lang=en,,,2793035658,,0,,0

Codourey; Roland Siegwart,"In micro or nanorobotics, high precision movement in two or more degrees of freedom is one of the main problems. Firstly, the positional precision has to be increased (< 10 nm) as the object sizes decrease. On the other hand, the workspace has to have macroscopic dimensions (1 cm3) to give high manoeuvrability to the system and to allow suitable handling at the micro/macroworld interface. As basic driving mechanisms for the ETHZ Nanorobot Project, two new piezoelectric devices have been developed. ""Abalone"" is a 3-dof system that relies on the impact drive principle. The 38 mm x 33 mm x 9 mm slider can be moved to each position and orientation in a horizontal plane within a theoretically infinite workspace. In the stepping mode it achieves a speed of 1 mm/s in translation and 7 deg/s in rotation. Within the actuator's local range of 6 mm fine positioning is possible with a resolution better than 10 nm. ""NanoCrab"" is a bearingless rotational micromotor relying on the stick-slip effect. This 10 mm x 7 mm x 7 mm motor has the advantage of a relatively high torque at low rotational speed and an excellent runout. While the maximum velocity is 60 rpm, it reaches its highest torque of 0.3 mNm at 2 rpm. Another benefit is the powerless holding torque of 0.9 mNm. With a typical step of 0.1 mrad and a local resolution 3 orders of magnitude better than the step angle, NanoCrab can be very precisely adjusted. Design and measurements of the characteristics of these two mechanisms will be presented and compared with the theoretical analysis of inertial drives presented in a companion paper.

The low reduction of the transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible benefits over modern actuation styles implemented in emerging robotic prosthetic legs. Such benefits include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, and greater potential for power regeneration. Benchtop validation experiments were conducted to verify some of these benefits. Backdrive and free-swinging knee tests confirm that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (~3 Nm). Bandwidth tests reveal that the actuator is capable of achieving frequencies required for walking and running.

On the engine side for instance, cylinder deactivation can reduce the fuel consumption of an internal combustion engine (ICE). Friction losses of the non-firing cylinders still remain. Therefore, ICEs which are mechanically divided into two individual engines promise an even higher potential in terms of fuel economy. The objective of this paper is to present the concept of a clutch unit that is able to connect two ICEs. Thus, it is possible to create an innovative, cost- and fuel-efficient powertrain architecture for automotive applications: This is the concept of the Split-Crankshaft Engine (SCE). In a first step, this powertrain architecture and its particular requirements will be discussed. In a second step, a selection of proposals for crankshaft connecting clutches that have been presented in recent years will be detailed.

In order to reduce costs and weight as well as to minimize activation durations, the secondary engine will be started through a friction clutch. When the two sub-motors are synchronized, a form-locking, second clutch will be engaged in order to ensure the connection of both engines at high torque.",4,3,92,100,Engineering; Longitudinal engine; Crankshaft; Clutch; Torque converter; Fuel efficiency; Internal combustion engine; Cylinder (engine); Powertrain; Mechanical engineering,,,,,http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1271627 http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.jmea.20140403.02.html,http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1271627,,,27751749,,0,068-863-997-935-511; 093-972-694-556-759; 095-352-063-092-084,0

In this context, extensive research is being conducted for the design of high torque density electrical machines able to meet the high reliability standards required. For low-rate duty applications (e.g. landing gear extension, retraction and steering; flight control surfaces), this can be achieved also by exploiting the characteristic that the motor does not reach a thermal equilibrium. In this work, the principal aim is to investigate the main limits in the design of low-rate duty, high torque density electrical machines and to propose methods for the improvement of the performance and reliability of such machines. This is achieved through detailed analysis of the motor design issues, of its thermal performance, as well as of the most critical ageing phenomena during operations. A structured design procedure for surface mounted permanent magnet machines is presented. A novel thermal model which features high accuracy and low computational cost is presented. A novel winding insulation lifetime consumption model which relates the winding time to failure to its temperature profile during operations is proposed. As vessel to address the thesis’ objectives, a fault tolerant electrical machine, which is an integral part of an actuator for the extension and retraction of a helicopter landing gear, is designed, built and experimentally tested. The tests are aimed at validating the design procedure and the thermal model accuracy. A series of accelerated ageing tests is conducted on samples of the motor windings, which serve to analyse the insulation degradation processes under different stress levels and to validate the proposed lifetime consumption model.",,,,,Structured analysis; Magnet; Automotive engineering; Actuator; Flight control surfaces; Thermal; Landing gear; Electromagnetic coil; Computer science; Fault tolerance,,,,,http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/48112/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.728633,http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/48112/,,,2784103579,,0,,0

The power transmission mechanism between the stator and the rotor is analyzed, and a method for realizing low-speed–high-torque characteristics of TRUMs is proposed. ANSYS software is used to simulate the modal parameters of the stator, and the ratio β between the normal amplitude and the tangential vibration velocity of the stator is proposed. The larger the value of β, the lower the speed and the higher the torque. Furthermore, two prototype motors are fabricated, namely, 70HA and 70HB. Compared with 70HA, the maximum no-load speed of the improved 70HB (50 rpm) is decreased by 23.1% and the maximum stall torque (2.4 N∙m) is increased by 100%.

The main difficulty in applying magnetorheological brake lies in the magnetic hysteresis. To deal with the magnetic hysteresis, a magnetorheological brake was combined with a micromotor to construct a hybrid actuator in this article. A novel hollowed multi-drum architecture was adopted for the brake so that the micromotor could be placed inside the brake to obtain a compact structure. The brake produced the maximum torque of 1263.39 mN m with 40 mm diameter and 28 mm length. Through the closed-loop control, no obvious hysteresis loop was observed in the hybrid actuator current–torque figure. The maximum difference between the forward and backward torque was reduced from 7.2% to 1.94% of the total torque range. The dynamic range was increased from 41.17 to 45.42 dB.

Newman; Bruce Steinetz; Carlo Kopf; John Malik,"Space and mass are at a premium on any space mission, and thus any machinery designed for space use should be lightweight and compact, without sacrificing strength. It is for this reason that NASA/LeRC contracted Unique Mobility Corporation to exploit their novel actuator designs to build a robot that would advance the present state of technology with respect to these requirements. Custom-designed motors are the key feature of this robot. They are compact, high-performance dc brushless servo motors with a high pole count and low inductance, thus permitting high torque generation and rapid phase commutation. Using a custom-designed digital signal processor-based controller board, the pulse width modulation power amplifiers regulate the fast dynamics of the motor currents. In addition, the programmable digital signal processor (DSP) controller permits implementation of nonlinear compensation algorithms to account for motoring vs. regeneration, torque ripple, and back-EMF. As a result, the motors produce a high torque relative to their size and weight, and can do so with good torque regulation and acceptably high velocity saturation limits. This paper presents the Unique Mobility Corporation robot prototype: its actuators, its kinematic design, its control system, and its experimental characterization.

On the contrary, a variable valve actuation (VVA) system would allow to exploit different valve-lift diagrams, according to any operating conditions, in order to obtain high torque at low speeds and high power at top speeds, on the same engine, so improving its mechanic characteristic. Moreover, ""VVA"" systems operating on the intake-valve only, can provide the engine with a method to control its load without using the conventional throttle-valve, therefore avoiding the corresponding pumping losses. Experimental tests have also shown that adequate ""VVA"" strategies can exert positive influences on brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust-gas pollutant-emissions. More recent interesting ""VVA"" solutions have been exploited, concerning port deactivation for charge motion control, engine modular operation, more efficient engine brake system for diesel-powered vehicles, more advantageous management with turbocharging.

In robotic surgery, compact manipulators with multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) are essential owing to a small work volume in the patient body. To generate multi-DOF motion, single DOF actuators such as electromagnetic motors have been conventionally used. That, however, requires multiple actuators, which in turn results in bulky mechanism combined with reduction device. In recent years, various compact multi-DOF actuators have been proposed and developed. Among them ultrasonic motors have become popular due to its simple structure and high torque capacity. Our previous work developed an ultrasonic motor capable of generating a multi-DOF rotation of a spherical rotor using three natural vibration modes of a bar-shaped stator. This study develops a novel multi-DOF master-slave system for surgical procedures using the single ultrasonic motor. The system consists of surgical forceps on multi-DOF wrist with joystick controller.

199-896-737-924-075,HIGH PRECISION MICRO POSITIONING SYSTEMS USED IN UHV APPLICATIONS,,2007,,,,,,Reinhard Degen,"The advantages of miniaturisation, e.g. low masses, low power consumption and small dimensions open new fields of applications for powerful micro actuators in areas dealing with particular environmental conditions like ultra high vacuum or wide temperature ranges. In fact these kinds of applications are mostly challenging positioning tasks, such as the sensitive movement or exact adjustment of sensors, optical devices, probes and tools. In addition to their miniaturised dimensions and low weight the micro gears should offer a backlash-free and precise angular transmission behaviour for such applications. The Micro Harmonic Drive ® gear is the worlds smallest zero-backlash gear system. Originally invented in 2001 by Micromotion GmbH this innovative gear design has successfully been transferred from a research environment into numerous industrial applications. The combination of high reduction ratio, excellent repeatability, high efficiency and high torque capacity offered by this gear principle make it highly suitable for precise positioning applications in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, medical devices, measuring equipment, optical devices as well as ultra high vacuum, aircraft and even spacecraft. This micro gear, with an outer diameter of down to 6 mm and an axial length of only 1 mm in the smallest currently available size, provides gear ratios between 160 : 1 and 1000 : 1 in a single stage (1). These high ratios are necessary to convert the very high rotational speeds of up to 100,000 rpm and very low output torques in a range of some /Nm provided by current micro motors (2), (3) into lower speeds and higher torques as required by real applications in industrial machines and equipment. The gear is manufactured by a special production process, called ""Direct-LIG"", by which the individual gear components are formed galvanically in a 3-dimensional mould produced from a photoresist using X-ray lithography. However actuators for applications in areas like UHV, Cryo technics, aircraft and spacecraft have to deal with further requirements in addition to properties like zero backlash, high positioning accuracy and extreme demands to reduced mass and dimensions. Due to its unique functional principle the Micro Harmonic Drive ® gear offers the possibility to operate at extreme environmental conditions. To be able to use actuators reliably also at extreme environmental conditions, like UHV or wide temperature ranges, there have to be fulfilled special arrangements in relation to the built-up, the materials used and in particular to the lubrication system.

The tool interface also includes a clamp that holds a tool on the peg, and a pair of fold-out cameras that provides close-up stereoscopic images of the tool and its vicinity. The field of view of the imagers is actuated by the clamp mechanism and is specific to each tool. The motor drive can power any of a variety of tools, including rotating tools for helical fasteners, drills, and such clamping tools as pliers.
